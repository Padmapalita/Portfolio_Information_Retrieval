They weathered storms and turbulent waters for weeks lightning scored the heavens and thunder throttled their ships with every brooding Rumble the Tempest appeared to be a dark Omen sent by the gods themselves. Selves but penthesilea did not heed warnings from any man or God. She forged on determined to reach the mainland within a fortnight as the Amazons approached the outskirts of Athens.

They descended on Athens walls howling and screaming like Banshees. The Amazons pushed past the gates to find the Athenian Army still scrambling to organize their soldiers They seized their vulnerability not hesitating to cut down any man in their path an hour later. They had blazed halfway through the city the warrior women fought their way toward theseus's Palace leaving a trail of bodies in their wake the Amazons had expected an entire Legion.

As soon as the Amazons penetrated The Heart of the City Theseus collected his troops and fought back with a vengeance the Athenian Army outnumbered the women warriors 5 times over and soon they had them surrounded in Athens Acropolis without their general or their Queen to lead them. The Amazons were almost entirely cornered by the time penthesilea emerged from theseus's Palace. And led her people to retreat more than 300 of her Fighters had fallen in the onslaught the Amazons had suffered a devastating defeat unable to conquer Athens or rescue their rightful Queen. They returned to a radius to recover from the loss and to mourn their dead, but penthesilea would never be the same the horrible Tableau of anti appeased. Death had etched itself into her mind every time the young Queen closed her eyes images of her sister gasping for breath in a pool of blood and silks appeared and when a storm would howl across a radius has forests penthesilea believed she could hear the desperate cries of anti appease infant son in the wind the young Queen was plagued by despair. And wished for her own death, but it was forbidden for an Amazon Warrior to take her own life and honorable death on the battlefield was the only form of self-destruction that penthesilea could hope for she longed for an opportunity to sacrifice her life to Aries and clear her honor with blood and soon she received her chance. On the coast of the Aegean Sea the kingdoms of men were waging a long and ruthless battle when Paris Prince of Troy and son of King Priam abducted the beautiful Helen the Spartans came and lay Siege to the city. The Trojan War had begun Troy had recently lost its Champion Prince Hector to the Invincible Achilles who fought on the side of Sparta. In the wake of Hector's death King Priam was in desperate need of an ally to support the Trojans in his stead. He searched high and low for any man to come to their aid against the Greeks, but it was a woman who heeded the call. Penthesilea agreed to sail to Troy to fight on the side of the Trojans, but on one condition she would go alone. Amazon's historically did not fight in men's battles and she refused to involve her people in what was ultimately a foolish squabble over a beautiful woman penthesilea had been waiting to cleanse her soul on the battlefield and join her sisters in the afterlife. If King priam's request delivered that opportunity to penthesilea on a silver platter fighting the indomitable Achilles was a suicide mission and she would not bring another Army to Greece just to be slaughtered but when penthesilea announced her plan to leave a radius to fight the war of men she was met with resistance her people insisted that they accompany their Queen. And soon 12 of her best warriors stood pledging to die alongside her in battle. They were a Nia whose name means swiftness Alka be and anti broght Bray Musa whose name means raging female cleat and dairy makea dairy. No boy the Dark-eyed heartmath oi and pull a Musa Therma Dosa her most skilled. Warrior with a spear and entendre whose name means one who goes before men. The very next morning the small band of Amazon Warriors sailed the Black Sea for Troy Days Later penthesilea noticed that the once Blue Horizon had begun to burn read as their ship drifted closer to shore. The horror of the Trojan War came into terrifying View. the city glowed Crimson with the Flames of the burning City The Faint screams of soldiers and citizens alike could be heard in the distance in the Trojan Port the Amazon sailed through a smoking graveyard of obliterated ships penthesilea had always known that coming to Troy would mean certain death, but seeing the devastation of the city laid out in front of her was something else entirely The heavy reality of what she had brought her Warriors to face sunk deep to the pit of her stomach sisters. We alone have been gifted with the ferocity of Ares the blood of War runs hot in our veins. Our heritage is Battle and victory our tradition today. We seize our Birthright if we fall it is an honorable death our ancestors call to us. To take our place among them in death. We will see our mothers our daughters and our sisters. We are Amazon's unafraid of battle unafraid of death. Meanwhile in Troy the Spartans had gained the upper hand after Hector's death the Trojan Army had suffered great losses and grown weak in the Relentless battle. They were mere days from surrendering to Sparta. But soon their hopes were revived by their glorious new Ally. Why? Penthesilea and her twelve Warriors rode Straight Into The Fray and Trojans and Spartans alike turn to watch as the fierce women galloped into battle the Amazons crouched forward over the next of their horses long hair streaming behind them their armor glinting in the midday Sun they rode together with an almost unearthly Grace at once beautiful. And terrible the Trojans cheered as the Warriors swept past. Finally, the daughters of Ares had arrived as the two lines clashed penthesilea and her Warriors cut down every Spartan in their path the Amazon queen blazed through the ranks like a wildfire through a forest one by one. She pierced the backs of those who fled and any man that dared to charge her was struck down in a single. Low soon, the long shaft of her spear was streaming with blood. The cacophony of War flooded penthesilea has ears the screams of the injured echoed across the battlefield while the clang of Swords rang through the din in the chaos of the onslaught. She realized that she had lost sight of her Fighters. But as she scanned the battlefield penthesilea saw that her band of Warriors had been thinned to just three then she saw him. Achilles stood taller than any man penthesilea had encountered his bronze armor shown with the fresh blood of Trojans and around him a ring of corpses laid in his wake in the next moment entendre Road in for the attack the Amazon launched her spear at Achilles, but it's Point simply ricocheted off his armor as entendre rode around. The champion penthesilea watched as a kill. He's caught her by the hair and pulled her off her horse, then in one swift movement. He drove his sword through her chest for a moment penthesilea stood Frozen in the churning sea of battle her eyes trained on the horrifying scene before her she had finally seen the man that would Grant her the uh, honorable death. She had longed for penthesilea steeled herself and called to him Achilles beasts among Greeks come stand before my spear or are you like all men Too Proud to face your death? As penthesilea screamed her challenge to the champion the Skirmish slowed and the sounds of battle hushed All Eyes watched Achilles and the Amazon queen the champion removed his sword from the dead entendre and walked toward penthesilea. The two Warriors met each other in the center of the plane. I am afraid of no woman, especially one who chooses. Ride safely a stride her Steed then perhaps you will fear a daughter of Ares on her feet in one movement penthesilea dismounted her horse and withdrew her sword from its sheath. She walked slowly toward Achilles. You walk towards your grave Amazon. I will tear you apart by sword or spear. How would you prefer to die penthesilea replied by striking Achilles? A sword out of his hands sending it clattering to the ground spear. It is Achilles and pendous Alia exchanged blow after blow their weapons falling into a rhythmic Symphony of clashing metal though penthesilea found that she was faster than the champion every hit. She made was futile falling. Useless on Achilles armor. She quickened her Pace dodging Achilles Spear and soon managed to send his shield flying off into the distance. We have Chow stood long enough Warrior Queen come meet your death penthesilea charged achilles with all her strength, but the moment she reached out to strike. He thrust his spear low delivering a blow to her legs penthesilea. Was sent stumbling to her knees repeatedly she struggled to walk but the wound had rendered her immobilo Achilles turned his back on her and began to walk away Achilles. Don't you dare turn your back on me. You are no child of Aries woman, perhaps now you will remember that coward come back and finish what you've started Achilles stopped and turned to look at the Wounded Amazon penthesilea stumbled toward him dragging her sword in the Earth the blood from her maimed legs mingling with the dust beneath. Her feet Achilles was astonished with her strength. What kind of woman was this? What is your name Amazon? I am pet the Cilia daughter of at rera sister of hippolyta and at eiope third Queen of the Amazons. And you will give me a proper fight without a word Achilles sprinted toward penthesilea. And in the next moment drove his spear down through the breastplate of her armor piercing her heart. Achilles withdrew the spear from her body penthesilea remained kneeling but as soon as the blood began to run from her chest, she slowly sank to the ground Achilles knelt next to the Fallen Queen never before had he watched an enemy so closely as they faded and he found himself growing curious. He removed penthesilea has helmet Underneath covered in blood and dust was the most beautiful woman Achilles had ever seen. She laid in all her shattered strength tears streaking her dirt stained face. She cast her gaze to the heavens and struggled to speak at last. Let me have Grace. Penthesilea, the third Queen of the Amazons and the last surviving daughter of at rera was dead. a queen slaughtered at the hands of men just as her sisters had died so did penthesilea but unlike the murders of anti EPI and hippolyta penthesilea is death by Achilles spear was not unintentional as the witness to her sisters killings penthesilea knew what lay in store for her whether her death would be directly dealt by men as it happened when hip-hop Lita was slain by Hercules or indirectly as when entire be was murdered by her own people for falling in love with Theseus penthesilea sensed that her fate would be similar. If she didn't die of men's brutality penthesilea feared she would live long enough to witness. Her people's domestication as the territories of man expanded existing as liberated women was becoming an impossible. Dream, so penthesilea took control into her own hands and Met Death on her own terms continuing to fight men would be endless and futile. The Trojan War was at once her Swan Song and submission. Penthesilea is death and the death of all Amazon Queens was used by the Greeks as a cautionary tale a warning of what happens to those who Dare to Live their lives outside the jurisdiction of men whether it was due to rage lust or wore these others would meet a violent and we see this in the Greek Mythic script dooming all Amazon's to defeat and death. Despite their courage skill and divine blood Amazon's would never emerge Victorious over men no matter how hard they fought or how much they suffered they were destined to fail and spectacular bloody fashion again and again, but what if the tale of penthesilea represents something else entirely rather than men's Invincible nature. What if penthesilea story Tells of their cruelty the name penthesilea means mourned by the people from the Greek words pentos and Lalo's this implies that instead of a figure to be blamed and feared penthesilea was perhaps a martyr a beloved figure holding men accountable for their misdeeds as she suffers penthesilea holds a mirror to man sins and forces us to look. Look, but the story of penthesilea has done more than reveal. The pain man has inflicted. It is given us a champion. The myth of the Amazons has been resurrected from the battlefield of Troy and proliferated in literature media and even cultural revolutions what once were cautionary tales of feminine Folly have been reclaimed as symbols of women's strength and tenacity. t Thanks again for tuning into mythology will be back Tuesday with a new episode.

Next was Nikola Grant upon hearing the shots many of the employees ran to the window to see See what was happening what they saw was a woman. They all knew Jennifer San Marco. In fact, the shooter worked for the company for many years before being asked to retire for health reasons when she made contact with her scared X workmates.

So, why did Jennifer do it? Why did she go to a place where she worked where she found friendship and take the lives of six coworkers? Well, the answer lies in the reason Jennifer was asked to retire and in the stories of those around her Jennifer born December 6th, 1961 in Brooklyn New York went to work at the postal plan after leaving high stress job of police dispatcher in the mid-1990s in 2003.

       " \"I started over on my personal style a little over 2 years ago. Before that I didn’t have anything to wear that I felt confident in or that matched. I felt like it was holding me back as a petite woman in a design field. I started over with a basic color scheme and really a capsule of just the most basic items I needed to survive that season. Each item was made with fair-trade practices and quality in mind, so I spent more on those initial pieces that I ever had spent before. I had to tell myself that I’m paying for quality and craftsmanship, and I felt pride in what they made. I took care of those pieces and I still have most of them today. I started taking my OOTD photo every day on Instagram for a full year, and since then I’ve developed a closet that works together well. EVERYTHING matches. I no longer have cheaply made jewelry or fabrics that just fell apart on me anyway, and I did that with intention. So even though naturally I’ve expanded my collection over time, I’m never flippantly buying things that I’m going to throw away. So 5 fashion Items I’ve started investing in:   High Quality Fabrics  Gold or Brass Jewelry  Higher-end Lingerie  Versatile Shoes  High Quality Purses and Bags  These investments are almost all accessories. Invest in daily higher-end items that people won’t get sick of seeing you in. If you will be interacting with many of the same people every day, then I would avoid wearing anything easily recognizable like “Oh you’re wearing the polka-dotted hoodie with the bunny ears again”.\\xa0 Investing in the right parts of your closet is important. Hopefully this is a good direction if you’re not sure where to begin. Hopefully it helps you find the best return on your wardrobe investment. Hi guys today. I am going to post it to my podcast again. And I just love doing these video podcasts where you can find like the video version here on YouTube. But then also I've got the audio version through different podcast platforms. So I'm sure that whatever is sort of like podcast platform that you listen to is where you can find me and it's called only looking up because I mainly talk about Petit things. But yeah, it's been a few months since I posted there.And time has just flown. So I'm really excited to start today with a series maybe just like a miniseries that I want to put together ideas for called adulting. Basically anything that I've started doing as an adult that has really transformed the way that I look in my fashion or beauty or whatever that is. So today. I wanted to talk about five fashion items that I've invested in recently. So that's kind of what I'm going to be discussing today. It's going to be really chatty. I've got my coffee. So hopefully you can just sit back and let this roll and I don't know it's just going to be a really fun topic. It's close to my heart for those of you who maybe are new to my Channel or new to me. I just started a couple years ago on my personal style Journey meaning I found myself in a place where I was really It just strapped on my budget. I really didn't want to put a lot of money into things like clothes or anything like that. I wanted to just focus in on my finances and that worked for the time especially and it's always important and I never want to say anything that would be a reflection of what you should do with your finances is very personal, but for me, I found that clothing it was just last on the list as I was also. So faced with this career of being a designer, I found that I wasn't at a point in my career where I should be making those cuts on my wardrobe because I wanted to be taken seriously in things like meetings or you know, I've talked to other people who are faced with kind of the same thing in their career if you maybe are taking care of someone's children. I know some person some one of my friends that she was faced with that too. And she wanted You be respected by the parents. So instead of dressing to take care of the small children. She started dressing to impress the parents and give trust to the parents. So that was just one example of how clothing can impact that so I approach this topic delicately because I find that it's super important and it will have a big return on investment, but I know that not everybody is at a place where they want to Best in their wardrobe at the time. So that's kind of where I'm at. Today is discussing where you're going to find the biggest impact on your higher-end purchases of your wardrobe. So if I was just completely Starting Over Again day one, you know, that's where I found myself a couple years ago. I ended up investing in just a few small things to build rebuild my wardrobe from the ground up instead of having everything. Kind of mismatched or just bought out of maybe an Impulse even though it was more on clearance or whatever. I wanted to invest in just a few items. That would give me the longest impact meaning it was more quality than I was used to paying for. And then also it just had a big impact on the versatility of the pieces. That's pretty much it. I'm going to just going to go into it. But again, I think that this really We will have impact for anybody who wants to be taken more seriously, and maybe it's just for a few key moments in your life. Like maybe you're buying a car selling a car. Maybe you're going in for a job interview. I've been on both sides of the table for that. I've been the one being interviewed. I've given interviews So This Is My Jam, I love talking about this. I love talking about how to dress to impress and then do doing that with versatility. Okay. Now further Ado, these are the five things I would say to invest in as an adult one is the right Fabrics. So to me, that means high quality neutrals. I find that that I really goes the furthest like when I first started I looked for what Sal button-down that I can wear like a white button-down would be such a classic piece maybe a black dress. So these are neutrals. These are things that you could blind. Ali go into your closet maybe with the lights off and it's you know, really early in the morning and you could just pick out a couple of things from your closet and they match that was my goal with when I first started it's still my goal. I've built my closet which is now bigger than it was when I first started but I can still reach into my closet and things match like I can mix and match anything really and it works so doing that intentionally, especially just with neutrals if you want to look more mature This is a great way to do that is just to find you know, black white brown neutrals as far as like maybe a linen without any dyes is so pretty it is like the prettiest color in the world I think but then also I really like things like a good pair of jeans like a good pair of blue jeans. So blue is in essence still a neutral genes. You might need to dress up a little bit for the sake of this conversation, but that would definitely be something Thing to do, but then also if you're going to buy something that you're going to wear frequently, it's helped me to be able to buy higher quality Fabrics. So instead of buying five shirts, like, you know, I just did a video on white t-shirts. It might be better to buy something that is a higher quality that you take care of and that will last longer than if you bought, you know, eventually five of them. Throughout the year because they keep getting dirty or whatever. And so there's things that you can do to protect white garments for that conversation as well. But I think that when I have bought something from Elizabeth Suzanne, which is much more high-end than a lot of the other things that I by then her Fabrics have lasted so much longer than a lot of the other Fabrics that are just like it. So in line with that silks high quality Eric you can't really buy that cheaply and if you do buy it cheaply it tends to kind of pick and not last as long maybe rip at the seems a little bit but when you do buy quality, it will last longer and you really do get what you pay for if you're looking for the right Fabrics. Another one is linen. I love linen, especially for this time of year where it's kind of warmer out where I am and just having something super breathable and I've And all sorts of different winnings from different companies and I would say that some are perhaps a little bit more see-through than others some might have a little bit more wear and tear and the weave might come a little bit looser. So that that's something to consider especially around the seams. I find the most use the most like deterioration if I'm not buying quality. So those are things to consider if you are going to invest in something that's a pure basic like a button-down shirt. Shirt or a black dress a black dress could be something that's hanging in your closet for years. And so instead of buying several throughout those years. You could buy one really good one that you feel confident in and when you go in for that handshake when you're about to have some sort of like car sale for instance or a job interview super important, then you're going to feel so much more confident knowing that what you are wearing. I don't know. It's like wearing a cape, you know, we just Feel empowered like a little kid who's wearing a superhero cape. And so that's kind of the idea behind this high-quality neutral Fabrics. They go forever you'll use them forever. And that is definitely something that has gone the longest for my personal style journey and being more mature and what I wear so one last note on that. I literally have some pieces that have lasted three years and they're still going Going they're not going to go out of style their higher end as far as the fabrics and their neutrals. So, you know, there's sometimes where a teal or whatever might be so on trend for the moment and that might be better on a statement piece or a more affordable piece that you can add on top of a basic but when it comes to Basics man, I am so particular about getting quality and something neutral and Timeless the next thing that I did when going through my personal Style Journey almost right away. I started adding jewelry and specifically gold jewelry can be something that will give you the biggest impact on how elevated your style is and day one for me. You know, I wasn't out there buying Linton gold jewelry necklaces or anything. I built my collection of jewelry over time and I'm still working on that. I don't have just, you know, Treasure troves of jewelry or anything. But one thing that I started with was brass jewelry, and of course you might find if you getting brass Rings or anything that might have a little bit of green around your fingers and stuff like that. But if you're careful with them, if you take off the Rings before you're washing your hands doing dishes whatever then that could be something where you're going to find that it's going to elevate your style and make you feel more confident as well like it right now. I'm not wearing many of my rings and It's kind of driving me batty because I just love to stack jewelry and have my rings on. I don't know. It's just something that makes me feel really comfortable. You know, I think that one of the first things I did was add a couple of brass necklaces and my friend she runs a company called windblown jewelry. She is a Powerhouse like she runs her whole business out of a closet and her pieces are just perfectly crafted by her and she's got a small team and it's just fun to take part in that and I also just really like her design. So I'll leave a link down in my description where you can find her jewelry and her pieces are very affordable to so that is where I would definitely go to to begin my jewelry collection. I also really like to now work. I like to work with Pamela card because I love her pieces so much. They're very artistic. They're inspired by History they each one is uniquely Handmade by really old ancient practices. And so when I wear her jewelry, I just feel like I'm part of that craft. So her pieces are a bit more expensive, but they are gold-plated. And so they aren't going to cost as much as it would cost if they were pure gold. So that's kind of how I make amends on wearing gold jewelry is that they might be sterling silver. Ernie 'The the gold and otherwise I really like to wear like bracelets that are very small and those ones will be pure gold but they are dainty. So anything that is pure gold that I wear usually is just you know, very small or like very thin Rings. Otherwise, I like the gold-plated effect for that as well for Rings. The Signet ring is really beautiful. So that's kind of my idea for jewelry and maybe gold isn't your I know some people just absolutely love silver and that might actually be more affordable to if that's what you're drawn to if maybe you have like cool tones to your skin. I know a lot of people who do love silver and that might just be a preference but I think that whenever you imagine someone who's just wearing a black outfit with jewelry, that's something you could wear when you're 20, that's something you could wear when you're 80, and there's just a timelessness to that. That and really you don't have to invest very much in your wardrobe. If you're wearing very neutral like black or Chic colors that are just elevated by everyday jewelry and the beauty of having jewelry and accessories is that you're not going to get sick of them. You're not going to get sick of wearing them as much or maybe you feel like other people are sick of seeing you in something that's not going to happen with jewelry as much as it would for Or you know, I've got a pink sweater that I absolutely love to wear but I can't always wear it because I'm thinking well, they're just gonna say the girl that wears the pink sweater. So that's kind of my thinking is where something every day especially if you're going to see the same people every day. That is timeless that maybe won't Define you as much as you define you maybe you should shine through more than the clothing so that's kind of my I thought there. Okay. This next one's a bit spicy, but I just absolutely feel like it is so true to thinking about how to mature your outfit how to adult and what I really think is true is wearing higher-end lingerie has made a more of an impact on my everyday Style on my confidence on knowing that my whole outfit is put together while and this is kind of a tangent. I actually Had someone just recently think me fervently for recommending nippies skin adhesives. So it's not really lingerie but it will make you feel more confident in what you're wearing and you don't necessarily have to think about that particular bra that will work just right for the outfit that you're wearing. So I had to briefly mention that because I do think that investing in something just like that has made an everyday impact not only on me, but other Oil so had to throw that in there, but also just wearing higher-end lingerie. I really like Florida mall, and I'm probably butchering how to say that but I just love the idea of having confidence with the things that I'm wearing. So if I was to wear something beautiful on top that I invested in and then I went to like The Bargain Bin and got a bra that didn't fit me just right maybe wasn't quite my size. Those are things to consider and I've got a video that more explains lingerie and my thoughts they are so I will link you guys over that way, but in a nutshell wearing higher-end lingerie that I'm confident in that makes me feel like I look my best when I'm wearing clothes or without is just what I think builds a confidence in me and there's nothing that I found that's given me more immediate confidence than when I go into my closet in the morning and I'm like, yeah. This is what I'm going to wear. And I don't know I just feel like I've got my life under control when I feel like from top to bottom from inside to out that my Alpha is put together well, and there's a sexiness to that there's a beauty to that and so investing in that was something that I didn't do day 1 of building my personal style, but afterward I'm like, oh my gosh, this has made such an impact on me and even my marriage so there you go. So higher-end lingerie was number three and number four is wearing versatile shoes. So the first thing that I did was I bought a pair of mules and they were basically my one pair of shoes when I first started they were from the solo and I actually did a video in back in the day just about that which was about how versatile they are and how they go with everything so I can link you guys to that video. But what I liked about this one pair of versatile shoes was that they were a neutral color. They were seasonally appropriate for the next couple of see maybe three seasons. I would say like starting early spring was a good time to begin my personal style Journey where I live because I could wear the same pair of shoes every day through spring summer and fall and I know that's not necessarily the case for where everybody lives but a good pair of closed toe. Neutral like sand colored mules was absolutely perfect for starting my personal style journey, and I still own a pair of those. I wore the first pair to death and I just loved getting to wear a pair of shoes out enough to where I had to go repurchase them. Like that's a sign of a really good pair of shoes. And I also think that adding a pair of shoes to my collection that had a very unique Look that could go with anything was another win. And so that's what I would say to invest in when you're going to invest in shoes, you know, people can pay a lot of money for shoes and they might not be the most versatile things in the world. They might not be the most practical if you have to walk a lot or go to different things maybe an office. I keep using the office example for this because I do think that it's where you find yourself needing to look the most mature. And be taken seriously and wearing something that's not completely a practical shoe is a good idea as well for that environment. And so finding a good pair of shoes that you feel confident in that elevates your personal style everyday is a absolutely great idea and there's been a few different pairs of shoes that I've worn just for fun and they are super fun to wear but they might not get me as far as I want to in my return on investment of what I'm buying. I feel like when I say things like return on investment that I'm totally killing the vibe of what I'm trying to say. It might sound like completely nerdy but that's really what I want to communicate to you guys today is if you're going to invest in a few key pieces in your wardrobe, what are the ones that have the biggest return on what you've actually spent money on and in my experience buying things like a good versatile pair of shoes or jewelry or, you know laundry that you Feel most confident in or just high-quality Fabrics that maybe you know, they aren't even high quality but ones that are more neutral or tone down can make you feel more mature. I want to also just briefly mention when I did work at Starbucks. You guys know that I worked at Starbucks when I was like 19 and I just loved having the the uniform that they made us wear. It was like back then it was like just blacks whites and khakis. That was it like Could not wear anything one time I actually had to go home. My manager was like no you can't wear those paired pants. They were a little bit velvety so they looked gray. I had to go home and change my pants. It was super embarrassing. Don't be like me. We're good pair of like black pants. Anyways, that's the tangent. For anyone who wonders if my necklaces ever get tangled. Yes, they do all the time. I just like to untangle them. It's kind of a hobby. Anyways, the last one that I wanted to discuss with you guys today number 5 of the things to invest in in your wardrobe is high-quality purses and this is something very recent to me. I really went as long as I could without investing in purses because I just felt like they were so much of an Mastery maybe something I could get by without maybe I could just you know carry something small or my outfit was doing good enough. I don't need to actually invest in a purse too. But since I've done that, I found that it has been a really great thing. So some of them have been gifted to because I waited so long in my career as somebody who talks about fashion online that I was able to actually reach out to companies and be like please sir. Can I have a purse? So that is kind of where I'm at now, but I have to say that I now get more compliments on my whole outfit by wearing one purse then I ever did before and it's just because I feel like if I wore the most basic t-shirt pair of jeans flip-flops, and then I added an absolutely amazing purse with it. It would be like completely acceptable and impressive. Just by adding the purse. So just like adding jewelry really had an impact on my personal style. I feel the same way about purses now and I don't really have a large collection of purses especially compared to some other people possibly, but I really just feel like adding one good black purse and one small beige. Purse is really all I need to get by and I feel like those pieces I could wear them. Every day and again, it's not something that I'm going to get sick of wearing. It's not something that other people will get sick of seeing and everybody's happy. And so I think that that's really a great thing because I could invest in just the most basic outfit and then again like jewelry purses will get you there. They will make your outfit look so elevated you will look so Chic and I think that's why a lot of people do invest in things like Louis Vuitton. I mean those bags are Everywhere and people can be on vacation and wearing completely like gym clothes would they've got their Louis Vuitton bag and I think that the thought behind that is that it is luxury and you can be more casual in your everyday life. But having that one thing that is more luxury elevates your style. I personally don't wear a lot of bags that have logos on them or anything like that. I like them to be a little bit more understated and that's my personal preference, but I also think that That by making decisions on my purse choices. I am trying to make them like intentional so ones that I can wear with anything that will be timeless that I could pass down even like purses are something you could pass down and they're vintage at that point. They're just absolutely amazing. Like oh this was my aunt's lovely purse name brand whatever but I do think that wearing something that is more understated even with your That are Chic will make them look more mature. So again, I think a lot of that is preference. But whenever I'm going to make a decision on what I'm going to get for my closet, I am thinking about does that actually look intentional is that an intentional design decision or am I just checking the Box me and my friend were discussing that because I came from a place where everybody in the town had their boxes checked. Meaning, you know, they had this type of car. They had this type of purse and you know, I came from a place where I mean, my family definitely could not check any of the boxes. So to me it was more like I when I got to a point where I could buy a box then what that meant to me was I want it to be something super intentional something super Timeless something classic and so that's kind of The box that I check is not one that everyone else is checking because what happens is they find that that one box that they checked is now out of style and they throw the Box away and then you're left with this box that you spent a lot of money on and it just doesn't it doesn't get you as far in your investment as it could and so that's kind of my discussion today is talking about. Peace. Isis in conclusion that will give you the most impact on your investment and the longest the longest amount of time as well. So if I bought a purse today, I wanted to look amazing, you know in 20 years when I give it to my niece like that's kind of what I'm thinking and I want to look amazing today without having to spend a lot of money on an outfit. And so that's kind of where I found myself a couple of Years ago, it's something that I'm very passionate about talking about because I love even now as I've indulged endeavored into all of these different things involving fashion. I can have a little bit more fun. Now. I can buy a few other pieces that are perhaps more fun a little less Timeless in sometimes they're not always Timeless, but they're always something that it's going to blend well with the closet that I've built. I was reading a blog post a couple of Years ago that was about how this one girl. She was in college. She really didn't have a budget at all for her clothes. But one thing that she did do is and her clothes were all just like neutrals her, you know exactly what I've described today, but then she bought one purse and one pair of shoes that could work for everyday use and she got compliments every day. She was able to go out and feel confident and these pieces weren't something Anyone got tired of and that was an inspiration to me. I don't know if you guys can hear that. It's a car alarm. But anyways, that was just such an inspiration to me and that has really been my goal. I even as a little kid you still love when Oprah would talk about stuff like this where she would say. These are the things that everybody needs in your closet and she would go through each one. Like the little black dress is obviously something that you'll always need or a white button-down or a good pair of jeans, like one pair of flip-flops one pair of heels one pair of Sneakers and I used to always have that up in my closet and make sure that like listed out that I had each one of those things that were essential to my closet so that I wouldn't feel lost. You know that feeling when you wake up in the morning and you just are looking at your closet and you like I have nothing to wear today ever since building my personal style. I haven't felt that feeling and it's so refreshing to be able to think I've built a closet. That meets my needs and I've talked about this a little bit but I think that my major key with this is to build a color scheme and I won't completely make a whole nother video segment to this video podcast, but I was saying building on a color scheme has been the most important thing to do. So when I say things like finding Fabrics that are neutrals, I really do mean it like if you can find your color scheme, maybe it's not neutral. That one is the most timeless the most mature then you will be able to extend the life of your clothes. You're going to be able to build on that so much in your own capsule wardrobe, which can be a capital of maybe a larger size. I don't have any definition there. I don't have a capsule wardrobe necessarily. I never really did except for when I first was starting over on my style. But I like the idea of everything just blending together working have being a purpose and I hope that that's that my heart of this conversation is coming through because that's really my goal is to set you up for success and to be able to have the best impact on what you're investing in. So that was a really chatty video. But I really hope that you like it so much if you're listening here on the podcast, please rate it and do all those things. I am not the most experienced podcaster in the world, but I Absolutely love to be able to post these out for you guys. Hopefully you are I don't know maybe he's stuck in traffic or something. And this is just major life a little bit more peaceful. Maybe it's given you some insight that perhaps you hadn't had before and I just love being able to talk with you guys. So doing these chatty videos. I mean having a podcast is just an excuse for me to be able to just like completely go off the rails and and speak my mind about these things. So I hope that you're able to get something out of it. So again, the five things that I would invest in fashion number one high quality neutrals. Number two gold jewelry. Number three higher-end lingerie that I'm confident in number four is versatile shoes, and the fifth was high quality purses. So I'll leave you guys with that. I hope you're having an awesome day. Don't forget to like subscribe rate, whatever it is wherever you're listening. Ting and I'll see you guys next time. Bye.\",\n",

Absolutely. Yeah a lot of wrestling to catch up with it was kind of hard. Yeah, would you do I worked all weekend actually fall for days. I was working. So literally on Sunday, I was catching up with the G1. I was catching up with slammiversary. I was just like wow, there's so much happening and then I gotta have everything done and watch while the next day. Okay. I was too much. My girlfriend and I we took a few days. I like the third and the fourth and we went and rented the air B&B right on the beach on Malibu ice white legit like the walk that when the when the waves hit they Splash up onto the front window right like the dog like, oh, wow, that's right fucking there. Yeah and just stayed there. You know, like, I mean, I went to the grocery store and filled the fridge up with groceries and and really just didn't leave like for two days. And watch the fireworks all up and down, you know like up from from where we were you could see all like Malibu's there's two there were two displays going on in Malibu and Santa Monica didn't have any but like Marina Del Rey did and like all the other cities down going south down the coast, right and you could see all of it was ridiculous. That's awfully nice getaway kind of connect a little bit Yeah and Lou, you know, Lou loved it. She The wave-like one of the Waves came up and like it pretty much covered her though. Yeah, it was it was fun. That's awesome. Yeah, what's fun? And and so I kind of forget about this until I'm right now I'm thinking about the weekend like so we left. and I'm driving back home from Malibu going down the PCH and there's a fucking you know the cops have someone pulled over on, you know, the opposite, you know the other side of the highway and and now we're driving a pretty small car and I'm driving and this fucking dipshit in a big-ass pickup truck just fucking slammed right into the back of rear-ended the fuck out of us. Oh, fuck. Oh, yeah. My girlfriend's like a Fucked up, you know I had to you know get looked at and you know lawyers like, you know want me to go get looked at and I'm just sure it might be something wrong with me, but I don't I can't tell yet. Like there's you know, I feel fine, right is that right is I'm all like, you know, I mean like I'm just used to it, you know, I live in chronic pain. So it was And this is when you guys were coming back obviously. Yeah. Yeah, so he just rear-ended you guys that would happen but we wasn't paying attention. He was looking he was fucking rubbernecking what I mean by that Rubberneck is like looking around when you're looking at the accident or even like well they say when another accident happens if you're looking at it, that's when another accident just like when you're when you drive in a big-ass pickup truck You can't like be a dipshit like that. Right? And that's a tricky stretch Road. Anyways, yeah, you know, I mean like yeah. Anyways, yeah, so I'm just my body is used to trauma sure. It wasn't a huge thing for me. Right but you're a little bit banged up. Yeah, is she? Okay like right now or I mean she's able to go to work and everything. But yeah. Fuck that's a second car is like that's been rear-ended last few months. What was the first coming to my house? I got no way to my house and 134 one night. I don't know how many months ago. It's been now. Yeah. So yeah for her poor thing anyways, all right. Yeah. Well at least yeah, I love you guys are okay that kind of shit as a good. My fucking weekend. Hey guys, I got a like yeah. What about the earthquake? Oh, yeah, we were there. Oh, yeah. Yeah, and then when we got home the next day I was so we got a ran a rental car right is the cards all fucked up and it's like a pickup truck and I come in to pick up in the parking lot or in the driveway at house, and I'm like the car. I started up and I'm like get ready back out and I don't know I stopped for some reason. I'm fucking around and in the driveway and all of a sudden the truck starts shaking. I'm like, yeah, what a piece of shit just our kids like this fucking thing is he's shaking. All right. Yeah, you know, my girlfriend comes running out like I'm like, I'm like what? Earthquake. Oh my God that it was definitely not fun at all. Everybody. I was just kept thinking like I really hope that the big one isn't like coming, you know, because everybody's always talking. Yeah a big one the big one where I like things are going to break apart. Well, that's the thing luckily. Luckily the epicenter of this was far enough away because it technically was bigger. That was the bridge Quake. Yeah. That was a big one. Yeah both but I mean like they just were like the one that you know, the one that's closer to the city or the fucking State of California Falls. I just keep thinking to myself like God like, you know, just don't let it happen. You know, I guess when you get I mean not like I'm this old fucking man already heard, but I mean, we I'm gonna do a little been to a thing or two like I mean, yeah, it was an event but it's not it wasn't really that big a deal right? And also when you when you live here It becomes massively Mexico and which could segue us into the next thing we want to talk about when I lived in Mexico. I had been in a pretty badass apartment building like and there was a six-pack a five or six that mmm, you know, Mexico City and the fucking building hit the neck like it was shake it so much it hit the floor next to it. So but they make those buildings down there. I think probably here to especially down there but there's much seismic activity. Yeah. Tell her I said that hey guys Mike activity. It's goes on down there. Like they make the even the foundation's I think are you know, like make the building so it's able to move exactly. Yeah. They say it's supposed to sway, right? Okay, right. But yeah, you mentioned living in Mexico your involvement with Lucha Libre. Obviously a lot of talk about locating the world. Let's go ahead. This weekend major news broke that the president of cmll pocket Alonzo has passed away at the age of 67 very unexpected. We still don't know the exact cause of death since he is a very private man. The family hasn't actually came out and said specifically what happened. All we know right now is that there was no actual plan in place. At least none that has these crazy for who is going to take over the company. So just a little background on this Paco has actually been running the P'nay since 1987 prior to that the company was founded and being run by his uncle Salvador who was running the company and was founded the company in 1933 making it the first major promotion oldest major promotion in Mexico. So it's probably in the world. Yeah. So this is like a big deal the fact that the person that was Reno in charge since 1987 is now, you know, God and we don't know what's gonna happen as of right now the person that is the I guess you can say the face of the company. It's his daughter Sophia Alonso who is 28 years old has a marketing degree, but apparently is not very knowledgeable of wrestling and wrestling so it's kind of like a very big only the wise words are circling right now, right the more ways than one unfortunately. Yeah Power grab I can see like everyone scrambling and yeah, I you know similar thing happened with with AAA with Antonio Pena when he passed away I was like, okay who's going to fucking run this thing? And that's how you know, Dory and ended up running. You know, what's 23 24 years old at the time sure, you know before that. He was the guy that brought me my pee when I came down to AAA and he gets to look like indoor use huge wrestling fan, right and just you know, all of that and in still like it was it was chaos. You know like how things were run after paying it passed away. And so it's yeah, there was I mean, it sounds like it's kind of a similar situation, you know not but people expected Pina actually when paying a past like he was sick for a while, right? So there was a little bit different but still without having any successor or you know, any kind of thought. Like I mean, I don't know, you know, whether he had you know thought about things like that. I'm sure you probably had mean wooden anybody in that sort of position would have to think about you even people that you know, they don't have much to their names. So your regular ordinary Jane Doe it's also going to think about stuff that you know, when you pass away your children money or if you don't I don't know if you have anything. But anyway, that's what I'm trying to say. Like even the regular person thinks about this. So I would believe that maybe they would have thought something about this but here's the thing too. Is that the family Self never cared about wrestling in the sense where their money and their big life focus is on real estate. So Paco was the one that was running things because he was the only one that I guess you can say wanted to you know, so now it's kind of like, you know, you could either have wrestlers that are you know, trying to get to that position but it's kind of that moment where you're like who rightfully goes to this. He was just like he wasn't the booker right? I got out of the booker. Who is it? Welcome, okay. They don't like him. That's how things go when you get a new person charged you get the people out that you're doing and I'm fat, I guess anyways, but I I have deal. I have my experience with Paco. I I can't I only met with him one time and I just nothing but positive wonderful guy wonderful wonderful guy and I'll tell you the story in a second and in that but everyone I know that work for him. Even people that like he had a grudge against iconian. I had nothing but good things to say about him. Hmm, you know, so my experience with Paco is you know, I don't think you spent a whole lot of time being mad at me, but I probably wasn't as favorite person after this and I could totally understand why so back when I was in In Mexico when I was living there and you know, I had I don't like it all off into what happened with me down there because that goes into a whole different direction. Anyhow, really bad thing happened with me down there and I went away for a while and I came back. It was basically okay was my suicide when I hang myself fuck might as well just say it right and so I went away for a while like four months. I was at this place. Houston is you know facility where I got better, you know menninger clinic by the way, just to give a shout-out to my anger clinic. So anyways, I when I leave there I go back to Mexico and you know, I was told like AAA was okay. They were they would give me work if I came back and honestly, I can totally understand them not wanting to book me after what happened with me. You know, like that's a major, you know, it's a huge thing and it's like what the fuck right is going to do this again if we bring him back to work so I get that but anyways, I go back down there thinking I got work no work. I'd lose my apartment like because I didn't have money to pay for it. Yeah, and so I ended up in living with Moody Jack Melendez who used to he was like kind of the booker. He you know edited the TV show did all kinds of shit there. And Moody also the computer Eco use, you know behind the scenes of big, you know, part of Puerto Rican wrestling wonderful guy. I love Moody. I miss him. He has my cat one of my cats still. Oh, yeah, Puerto Rico. So yeah, I'd have been homeless. I was basically homeless in Mexico and so I in this is where Mark jindrak you guys know, Mark jindrak for sure. Yeah, Marco Corleone. He's getting pushed pretty good, but But not as good as he could have and should have been sure and the MLL but CML, I'm sorry. Anyways, like so I would go connect what Mark while I was down there and you know like Mark talked to Paco because AAA wasn't fucking using me. So Mark talk to Paco Paco like watch some stuff in me and just really liked what he saw right? I call the WWE stuff and Anyways, he brought me in and you know, we had a meeting and they had this big 75th Anniversary. Show me the Mexico and yeah, so like I made a deal with them and he gave me a great deal like it was great. And so then they had this big announcement and press conference. I'm going to wrestle Ray bucking arrow for the like junior or light heavyweight belt and At the Big Show and honestly I got was I wasn't in I wasn't no kind of shape for a singles match like that. Right? Right, and I'd a me money like to try to prepare I fucked up. So but as soon as as soon as the big announcement happens and I'm on the magazines and everything. I'm going to go to Arena México for this now all the sudden Dorian AAA. Like whoa, what do we have to To do to get you to stay. Mmm. And like honestly, I wasn't prepared to have that fucking sick single night, like full disclosure being, you know thousand percent honest. I wouldn't I went prepared to have a matched singles match that quick. I looked like shit a lot of things and so and I was I knew AAA for better or worse I knew that and but so on I told Them, you know and I told my wanted and so to read in Mexico wasn't doing anything really with Rocky Romero or Alex Kozlov. Yeah, so I'm like, yeah give those guys a job too. And and and so but he really dirty and really wanted jindrak I see right and so like he's like, can you get a until I was okay Dorian, you know part of the deal was he had to give me a front. Cash bonus to come back signing bonus and so it's he's like, I'll give it you the bonus but you got to get a meeting with you know, Ginger at sudden meeting up with jindrak. So that happened. And anyways, Rocky and Alex came over with me and we started that group called degeneration Max. Right? Right, which worked pretty good like it was over pretty good. For Bunch baby, you know, you know American bases, right? Usually if you're an American, you're fucking heal. Yeah, right. So anyways. Yeah, and then jindrak came and so obviously I kind of reneged on the deal with paco right? And so you never ended up having them every but narrow never went to cmll after that after there was a big roll out the red carpet and everything. So yeah, see how he could be a very upset after that. I don't know how upset he was or wasn't but like yeah, did you guys ever talk and never after that? Never know? No. No, so but yeah, that's the story. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I'm not I felt like it was the best thing for me to do and it was right but I would not have been doing myself any favors going and having that singles match at Arena México sure at all so I know but I can see how like he know he gave me another just not right? Yeah. Yeah, it's crazy. Okay. So so anyways the deal I have with AAA so then like serves me right? It's my fault for fucking taking anyone's word for it. It wasn't a month or two or they he went back on his deal and I didn't end up like a pretty much fucked and oriented. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he knows it too. Yeah, I saw Dorian that double or nothing. Oh, yeah, we came up to me was you know, really cool. You see me. I was happy to see him. You know, I hope so, I think so, right, you know, I don't think he's who could like. I've said some shit about him like worse than you know me. Just telling the story right now, you know at times being mad about certain things and then like blown up on Twitter just stupid Twitter shit. That's right, you know, he kind of wish you didn't do afterwards. But yeah, so now I'm so pretty heartless like that is what happened, but I'm not only grudges over. And I wasn't the easiest guy. I like to I mean there was we had some complaints but nothing major Ryan's in major. I wasn't doing anything then I showed up at work. I did a great job at work. Hmm, and you know now I wasn't clean and sober but fuck who the fuck was in that locker room me a break shit. Wow. All right. Sorry. I'm just like blown away this story. Yeah. Wow, what a huge loss. Right great, man. Definitely and you know, yeah, so you think bummed out that that's my eat on the way that right there hands with Paco ended. So so what do you think's going to happen? Do you think it's just going to be like a just War brief lots of drama to come there's gonna be a lot of Yeah, that's going to prove. I just hope it doesn't result in like the ends of the company like whoever takes over. I hope that they just make wise decisions and it's a good pick someone else. There's a lot of things that like, okay for one thing. I never thought things. I never thought I'd see I never thought I'd see a AAA show an arena México. Hmm. That's fucking blew me away when I heard that right? I mean, I know they they rent the shelves out. I mean, I know like Arena México. I was renting it out to other promotions, but you're not their main competitor. Right? Exactly. You know, I mean, they run it out to the circus and like all kinds of shit like that and they make huge money Arena. México makes huge money on parking interesting. Yes, because it's you know, the that's basic kind of downtown is Right. Mmm. Well every fucking part of every it's all downtown. It's like Mexico's biggest fucking city in the world. But yeah, I know. Yeah, even when they're not running events, they have that parking lots full. Yeah, so all right. Well, we actually have to continue talking on so the few days prior to the death to the announcement of the death of Paco. It was announced that perro perro Aguayo passed away at 73 years old old biggest draw on masked wrestler. Yeah the city ever did. Did he ever wear a mask? I Remember that he was? Okay, so he okay. So I know that Conan beat him for his hair and he unmask Conan. Yes, so I don't recall him ever wearing a mask, but I could be wrong though in the state's, you know, like a pretty sure Kona and have had LA Sport's Arena or SoCal stay or anyways, where they had this big the cage match and sure, you know, the three-way Feud with Conan and CN goddess. Yes in cars, and then he Also had an in this Feud with Conan itself, which was you know, what how put Conan on the map started wrestling in 1968 help fund help fine found found. I can't even talk anymore AAA in 1992 his son as we all know died in the ring better Aguayo Junior in 2015 at the age of 35 breaking his neck after an enduring accidents. So that was you know, that happened just a few years ago, and now you know, he passed away and I know he had dementia, but I don't know of that. It's like the cause specifically in this death that may tie into it. We should imagine it probably had something to do with it. But in terms of you know a legend in Lucha Libre, this is like about as big as they get. Yeah, I mean just sort of like El Santo, right? Yeah. Exactly. Yeah everyone else. He's as big a star as anyone you could think of. Yeah, sure. So just like two big things that happened in the world of you know, Lucha Mexican wrestling literally within days apart. So it's kind of like, I don't know. It's pretty crazy. I think yeah. Wow, I just you know, it's so cliche a to go out thoughts and prayers and you know, all that wrap up me. What do you say? Yeah, we're saying, right. I'm just you know. and I'm not the big religious guy either about yeah, I know I I I'm sending some prayers their way. Sure everyone down there. Yeah, definitely had definitely a lot of a lot of big chicken up in the world of this really rare for sure. All right, so going to be more stuff to come special the whole cmll thing. So we'll keep updating people as we go but now we're going to go ahead and switch gear. So last week we were kind of talking somewhat of like what possibly could be great news for impact, which was possibly their move to access but now so good news for talent, but bad news for it. Packed so both Ali X and Johnny impact are gone from Impact Wrestling after slammiversary. What just happened in the Sunday actually in Dallas and okay. So let me just give you a brief break down Allie X has both offers from aw and WWE obviously if they go with aw, they're going to have really good competition terms of tag teams and the Bucks nutria Bros SCU Angelico Jack Evans got some competition that they could work against and you know how PW build their tag team division even more Obviously if they go to a WB either still a lot of great opportunity in terms of really good impact for for positive change or maybe growth I guess you can say yeah.

I'm interested to see where the because they're like It's somebody knows all there the best tag team in the world like you might have a different opinion John like you can't go all that's fucking crazy right now. They're dying up there for sure. I thought that was like best tag team in the world stand by the statement and then I found out the news that I was like, I'm not shocked at. All. Right, honestly like not shocked at all because in the ring, they're crisp they do these crazy things that you would think would come across as maybe looking a little sloppy, but no, they're done clean their hands to get a very very their Properly and you know, they have a lot in terms of the whole their whole thing like Persona Etc. And then with Johnny Johnny Johnny impact same thing like he can pretty much go anywhere. I'm assuming he's probably gonna go with aw. I don't know that's just my opinion, whatever wherever he goes. I hope he gets a great deal. He's he's very valuable still I think yeah, definitely more so far so I know he is I know he's definitely looking looking to get into more acting as well. So anywhere that might be able to kind of help that along so I wonder what's up with Taya her contract doesn't end with impact until I believe the end of the year. Okay, he still has a bit more to go and not so here's the thing about that. You know, we were talking last week about Access TV, you know, and then being in negotiation, but if you know huge part of Huge part of your wrestling promotion as your fucking roster, right? Right, right, and those are huge hits. So it's you know wonder what who do we have up there? I mean, we still have some there's pretty good cages. They're definitely cry. They had a lot of really good stuff on slammiversary Tessa Tessa and Sami callihan went had a really great inter-gender match and I'm saying this because when you watch that match it felt natural state Tessa in that ring against Tommy Callahan. It didn't feel like oh, this is a girl versus a guy and I'm so noticing that this is a woman in this match. No those storyline the story in the match was great. The match was great and they just had a lot of different things on the show that worked really well compared to this last year slammiversary. I think last year slammiversary was was was better to be honest and the hype and all of that Jimmy from last year where they went with slammiversary to now kind of it kind of sucks because last year they had so much. Type and how everybody was super excited and then this year it's kind of like, oh we're losing talent and you know, we're trying to get a TV deal. I think at this point it's like they need to get something right now because they just need something to kind of keep them pulling forward because you know, if they're their talent is being raided by both WWE and aw it's going to be like, you know, they got to have something to keep that talented. That's how it interested in staying with the company and I kind of feel like that's probably not there right now the talent we don't know what's going on, you know. Obviously, it could be being told one thing or another we don't know. So I guess it just kind of depends on that. Well, you definitely cannot blame. Any of them for you know doing what's best for them these these, you know, boom periods in the industry. They they last so long, right? Right and you got a fucking you got a score there's a window and you got fucking score while you can during these times, right? Yeah, the fact that there is so many options, right? Yes is a good thing. So alright good for them and then actually before Get to that I I'm gonna since you know, I'm just gonna throw this that I know as an order but because he said that there was a lot of opportunity it kind of ties into what's going on with galison Anderson re signing with WWE. So it's been noted that they signed five-year contracts apparently prior to this they were offered 500 thousand and that was rejected. We don't know the actual number in terms of what they got. But obviously it's going to be more than that 500k. So one can only assume they're talking like some big like in the millions type of money for them. M so considering the fact that they weren't, you know, really a focus on with the company prior to this and now, you know the are with the club and AJ Styles and all of that, you know big move for them, but your fingers use them properly. They're really fucking valuable right don't have doing stupid shit. Right exactly. You know, like the fucking shit. They were having them do like the little ha ha fucking when the kind of first came around. Well even like I don't know if it was when they first but I can just remember even You know not that long ago. I'm right not that many months ago like like, um, like kind of like, you know, like I don't know there was a their segments like there was an attempt at comedy though, right exactly, but just know know which end they and I understand the the the temptation to do that because they are so funny and we've seen them before, you know with like South Pain stuff like that really use their sense of humor, but hopefully they they can get taken seriously this time around round now that the bring the club back now that they're putting them with AJ. So I just wrote since we're talking about Gallows and Anderson and this is going off into the weeds just a bit but it's I saw a match from a few years back just the other day and it was Carl Anderson. He beat ton of Hoshi. Yeah. What a great fucking match. That was absolutely. No. I just saw it the other day, and I just wanted to give you Props to that and I'll fucking great Anderson wasn't yeah. He did all my God. He did so much good stuff in Japan even even before, you know, like both of you can use him as a singles guy. Yeah you like I mean wait ways. All right. I just think like in terms of like talking real big money. Like they're one of those people is that afterwards when all of this like grabbing Talent thing. It's sort of like, you know slowed mellow down. It's kind of like they're going to be one of the people that really It it from this whole time right thing. Mmm. All right, let's move on. Let's talk about Sean spear. So there was a little bit of I guess you can say controversy. So Shawn Spears was pulled by aw from Limitless wrestling. He was supposed to do a show Friday night on July 12 a day before fight for the Fallen fight for the fallen on July 13th. So essentially what was noted was that this was already set in place prior to him signing with aw. They were already, you know. He was he was committed to that bright and aw was like, okay, you know, you're gonna come out July 13th, that's fine. You'll be there. So apparently they kept sending flight information to aw and kept saying like oh like is this the good fight for him because a good flight for him. Apparently, they weren't hearing back and they were like not getting a correct answer and then afterwards apparently what happened was that after the flight thing they basically say like, okay we're going to pull him off because he's Going to have to do a photoshoot the day before. So after this came out and they and Limitless wrestling posted this online, you know, some fans were very upset and they and the Bucks and Cody did face some backlash after this. So because of that the backlash and all of that he is now put back and he's now still doing Limitless wrestling but a lot of people did raise some, you know, some concerns over that. Okay. All right. Well, I mean, sometimes those things happened. Hmm, and I sometimes you know, yeah, so what do you do though as a new company? Like how do you say like, you know, obviously both aw and Limitless wrestling had their Pros like, aw obviously needs him for you know, their photo shoot all of that stuff whatever and so does Limitless Limitless wrestling. They also have the thing where does aw say like we're going to put our foot down in this one because well, it depends how you know, apparently it wasn't it wasn't That big a deal after all like when they really thought about it, but it could have been something where it was like no, we really do need to pull him and that would have just been hey like sorry. Yeah, that sucks. But like if there was something like yeah, we're I mean, that's his bread and butter. I think I don't know what his deal is. I mean, I don't know what the nature of their deals are there, right? But I think I know I imagine that someone realized that at this point it's not That bad publicity, you know if this was something that was already set in stone way before he even signed you try to provide some sort of moral values. Yeah. They were going to provide Tommy Dreamer. I believe well, it was aw going to provide that or did Limitless secure that on their own. Oh that I don't know but I think because that was Tommy Dreamer that was the replacement but we don't necessarily know if that had anything to do with in terms of ghosts. But now they're kind of in an advantageous position where they get both now, so hopefully it all everyone's happy. Alright moving on so mlw has announced that their first pay-per-view is coming November 2nd in Chicago Saturday night. Superfight. Yeah. Is it going to be at that same place? They all they've been running Cicero Stadium Drum, I watch their show that was on yesterday yesterday. They what's it called fuck now. I can't think of the name of their show. They had right? Anyways, it was where Jacob fought to one title from Tom lawlor. Okay, and there was some other stuff on the show. I mean, I enjoyed the show. Yeah. I enjoyed it. You know, there was some things regular I wouldn't have the guy I would have put over in that or hatch or whatever, you know little things but Overall, like I appreciate what they're doing. Yeah, you know in the industry that was Kings of Coliseum gangs of Kasi. Mm. Thank you. Thank you Jeff. No worries terms of in terms of them building on the current hype and family that they have right now. This is probably better time than ever to do, you know to do a pay-per-view and stuff like that so I can call for them the people they're catering to a really enjoy the product. You know, it might not be everyone's cup of tea, right but I I see a lot of people that really enjoy it, you know and I watch the show and and I enjoy watching it and enjoy watching it. Hey, this is odd. We'll talk about it when we get to Rock Street profits. So yeah, alright. Alright moving on. We also had G1 climax this this weekend as well. A lot of really good matches a lot of talk. Let's first kick it off with let's talk about the audience and the crowd because there were some people that that were kind of pointing out the flaws of what was happening in terms of like how the production shot the audience and how the audience was and then there's people on the other side that are like no like the okay. So essentially people were sort of some people online were sort of pointing out like, oh look at you Japan. They didn't draw this many people Etc. Look at all these empty seats, but then there's other people that saw like, no like they had a great audience. Yeah granted. It wasn't sold out. We know that so big Let though they had a very engaged audience of her hot audience people that were into the show from start to finish what you know, Sean is not always easy to keep a audience fully engaged in the show, but there was a lot of conversation on that. Yeah, and so it's weird like people have a short memory of how fucking tough it was to put asses in seats not too long ago right to where they going all they can't even sell out a fucking American Airlines Arena. Hmm. They fucking over. Half that mean it was over half full. I think they said the number wasn't it the number like 4,000 or something. I don't know. It's it looked more than that. Okay. I bet I've wrestled in that building but you are you'd also mentioned a little bit before we went live that a lot of the crowd was on the the hard camp site. Yeah that happens and they're not a might just be presentation and that's not there like we were talking about before we went on air Access TV produced at right? Yes, so They're not in the rest in this tree where they are used to have to for cosmetic reasons like move people shot it like a real sport Charlotte like, you know, everyone else would shoot it. Yeah, right. And and yeah, so yeah, I would probably look better like aesthetically if you know, there were more people I thought the crowd the just fine. I thought it was very respectable because there was some shots like for example, there were certain shots where they had the, you know, the guy's head and then here on the right side or left side. That was just all these empty seats. So it's kind of like, you know for a fact that if that was your boy that's tough never they would have worked around it. There's certain ways. All they had to do is buy the stage put some black tarps on those those seats that were, you know, being used move the audience around a little bit and they would have had the energy and everything maybe dim the lights which I know they did it, but maybe the could have I don't know, you know, so I love and they've done it before like that's like I've they did it at the Cow Palace. Hmm. But lights would dim there after I watch the show. Alive I didn't watch it back on on TV. So I didn't see that but I see what you mean. They weren't them. Yes all fair criticisms, but I can we get past the criticisms to recognize all the great things about the show sure and like about the crowd and you know, like I mean in Dallas like downs, I'm pretty sure Dallas isn't Many have some Japanese ever Japanese Community there, but it's not like fucking Torrance, California. Right? Sure. Anyone that lives out here knows Torrance California has more fucking Japanese people that yeah, probably Japan. It's just like yeah, so honestly like for like for me in terms of like I had heard about these issues prior to watching the show because I watched the show the day after and I was just like, okay, but it kind of did make me upset that people were saying this because I was like, You guys are taken away from what's Happening inside the ring. Like people want people have been saying. Oh we want that a wrestling. We want better wrestling on TV. We want better wrestling. There it is. There it was natural turn itive. And so when you put on a show like that for that many people when you go back next time, they're going to be way more people right? That's usually how that works. Yeah. So, okay, you you the people that came were really fucking happy they went right? As opposed to going to show and being like, oh fuck that was too long. Some of them, you know, most of matches weren't that great, right, you know, so in many ways I didn't I don't think I saw every single match hmm. Definitely some fantastic a Block matches we can talk about the a balk matches. Yeah for sure. So, let's kick it off with Will Osprey and Lance are charged. Everybody was talking about this one. Yeah, and I have I saw a couple little things that could Been tightened up, but I'm not even going to mention them. Hmm. That's just me because it was it was great. That's how you know, as someone that my specialty was that style of match a David and Goliath. Yeah match right and and I just thought it was done. You know, I was done really well osprey. I think he's the best guy they have right especially for like, you know. The global expansion like can you know like say here in the States, you know blond hair fucking kill a blue eye, you know, right sure. Good luck and fuck her too, right? Yeah is Gears all you know and point. Yeah. I was hoping he would when rants did great though. I'm actually happy for Lance really happy for Lance. Yeah. Yeah. He's yeah, I hope Hope they do. I hope they use Lance more like moving for I pay you some better. I think that one of the highlights of this match was the fact that will Osprey sort of made Lance Archer kind of go up a level, you know, like obviously we know that will a spray, you know was the highlight of the match carrying everything Etc. But Lance Archer was in all the right spots, you know, it's you know, it's funny because I was actually saying it sounds like dude all lands Archer has to do is be in the right spot work magic cetera, right? Comment people going. Oh, they didn't sound like this and that I canít just fucking I just got a chuckle at some of these people. Okay, it was some of them with the psyche and all the cycle. There is no psychology. Look, I think I know I think I know a thing or two about in ring psychology and it was okay. It was a different kind of psychology. It was a different way of selling. And there was done very well very well. Yeah. So, all right. Let's talk about bad luck Folly defeat an evil. I didn't watch it. I'll match it was what you would expect from both guys. Sure so yeah, sounds good. Oh, there you go. All right. Well, let's talk about Sonata beating Zack saber jr. And wasn't really great technical magical fun considering that Sonata has you know, he was able to incorporate some of his like Lucha Libre techniques into this. So it kind of added for very good counters against Xavier Junior and I think he was what he's probably one of the few guys that could really change Russell with him in that sort of way where it It's not your average chain wrestling match with a little different. He ties like guys up front where they can't get out like and then he kicked him in the butthole, right? Yeah pretty much know that I don't I think did I miss it. You know, I mean my thing with that Junior is that every time I see one of his matches and I think I got it all figured out and I know he's gonna do next. No. Yeah, it's always something so different and you just think to yourself. Like how did you get from there to there are clouds in matches like that lately. I don't know it's coming puzzle and I think with him joining Suzuki wagon, he's been doing such good character work as well. Like not only is he one of the best in the ring, but he's doing such amazing character word. He said having a match like that for American wrestling fan just like reading Shakespeare to dog. I love that. Absolutely. I love that quote when I saw it. Yeah. Yeah, I think him and Sonata are two of the most well-rounded guys that they've got. So yeah, so in it was this match and I did think about it during like the Osprey match to but it was in this match right heard crowd the crowd react to some things that like You gotta be an educated crowd to be reacting to you know what? I mean? Some of the more intricate like yeah things like trademark things that maybe like someone that just is a casual watch her wouldn't pick up on right exactly. The whole crowd was they knew they know? Yeah, you know, so yeah, that's one of the things we mentioned off air was that this particular crowd where New Japan fans like you can tell, you know, some of these people had been following the product for a while not just when it kind of got that boom here. U.s. You know so I think that's kind of what made this, you know, we're really help the show, you know, obviously. Alright next match a Kenta defeating defeating Coda a Bushi. I enjoyed it a lot of other people that meant more to them than it did to me because I wasn't like I wasn't really up to speed on our cantor's work. Like I wasn't like into was at NOAA that he was a big deal in Yemen are Fuji and I like I was saying a different place in my life where I was at to actively, you know, not following everywhere. And so I'm happy to see him. You know after the WWE, right? Yeah, and I can have a good showing like that. Yeah, I get back to a style and a speed that he's kind of more suited to that was you know, so they used to boo boo. She you know, that was a that's a big win for for. Yeah for Continental. Yeah, definitely and I kind of figured That's probably what you know, what would happen but still wasn't sure because it boosts she's a big deal, right? Yeah. Definitely. I think that code is probably going to be one of those guys that go super far super far on this one. All right afterwards. We had okada versus Tana Hoshi. Yeah. Yeah can't go wrong with the other people like in that's another, you know, the crowd knew what they were watching and I thought they thought they were the crowd was a tub was a really good match. Yeah. Yeah. Always as yeah, and I really it's just you know, I've seen them I've seen their Matt. It was just nice to have a you know card a ton of Hoshi match in the states. Yes night but that being said I got was they didn't take it to the next level compared to their other matching solid. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, like it wasn't it wasn't one of their it wasn't one of the wrestling and that's fine, which is yeah. I think they should yeah. Yeah, because I think yeah when New Japan really started getting on a lot of people's Radars out here was during okada and Tanaka. She's kind of first real rivalry. And so yeah to have that sort of match in the states is really big and so also something that okay. That was okay. The match was over but that wasn't the end of the TV show. Hmm. They had backstage press conference. Right? And I love that the press conferences are all this awesome have to know what they're saying, right, you know. Nice to know subtitle and what oh, I know. Yeah the fucking The Interpreter though. Oh, they could have had a better internet. That's my only complaint. Right? Alright, so there you go. That was like that's what we have here with the the G1 climax next shows on Saturday. So Makemake probably talk about that afterwards. But yeah, it's like honestly it was a good show good show very solid show lots of good matches back to back. All right, let's go ahead and jump Into raw. All right. So whoo What do you want to start off with the whole thing? All right. Well, we can sort of talk. Let's get it, you know, so last week one of the major things that we talked about was the whole my Canal is Maria Kanellis. Think do you want to talk about let's go talk about the whole her wanting pickles and ice cream and this you didn't impregnate me and now we get like a even more teas that she's saying Mike analysis isn't the father what is happening here? I don't get it now. I just don't get it. Can somebody can someone please explain this to me? I okay. Yes. It's getting like No, no. No liked it. I mean what's better than last week? That's for sure. And I don't know. I don't know about now. It's really bad. I just don't even know what to say about this because I I mean just all of the jokes about the pregnancy cravings and stuff like that. It's so interesting is no no I'm talking about the fucking The way that the tree the way they're making him like for sure. Yes. We should be like upset by now. Wouldn't he be like I certainly hope so you mean like you weren't at wasn't mad enough to impregnate you. What are you trying to say to me here? You know, if you're a guy what's your response going to be to them your girl your girlfriend or wife or whatever is saying, oh you weren't man enough to impregnate me and Arnold out. Yeah, I'll keep it to myself. I just don't want to stir shit, right? Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. It's I did think the non-fat part was kind of funny because you know, the worst thing that guy can do is call a girl fat or insinuate that she's fat. So I did think that part was kind of funny. Okay? No. No, it was not Matt. I'm one of these guys that that understands that you know men have been the shit's for a I'm fucking tired, right sure and so a lot of the stuff that's happening. Now we have coming but God damn right? This is too fucking much. I just said like nobody's coming out on top. And yeah, what the fuck come on? What did we think about but about what do we think about Ray answering Bobby lies a balance? I hate it. Yeah. I don't hate him getting sacrificed to Bobby Lashley. I hate him coming out and going open town. Anybody in the back and then somebody coming out and fucking and just destroying and make some good dipshit. I hate to say cuz I was raised a legend right but not exactly a fucking do that. You know, it's fine that they're selling the whole I call Bobby lashes like this big large guy, but Ray has gone ahead with plenty of large guys. That's the thing is like I get the desire to want to make Lashley look strong going into the last man standing match on Sunday to make re look like a dish that you've got arrested. You've got a roster full of people that get him to do it. That's my take on you. Okay. So before we you mentioned the street profits before do you want to talk about that a little bit? Yeah. Hey, so what's that teams a private party party? Yeah. My theory is that those guys got a buzz going right after that from yeah. Yeah doubler. Yeah double or nothing all that right there. No history. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah, that's the one. Yeah and like so Street Roberts is a very similar gimmick. And so they're like, okay, let's Get them on TV. So everyone doesn't think the street profits are fucking knock off a private party. Right? But it's the the hardest part for me to Fathom is that they they bring up the brand new NXT Champions. One of the best teams in the company. All they're doing is just chilling the pay-per-view. I don't like I don't like I don't know. I don't want to keep going. I don't like this. I don't like that. I mean right because there's a lot of I mean, well, there was also some things I like World some people were also you know, Not the fact that they had the tag team inter-gender match with Becky and Seth and brother and Selena and the fact that it was only like women versus women and men in contact right some people feel like that was a little bait-and-switch. He liked people just were expecting to see some man on well in violence and they didn't get it. I think the only reason people might be thinking that is because we saw Becky tap out my Canales sure and so we thought oh maybe Be Silver Lining maybe we're getting slowly inching closer to inter-gender stuff. Yeah, but with this it just it it's such a weird decision to have a mixed tag match, but then make it a limitation because it's basically you're just looking at two separate one-on-one matches them. Like when we can only fight women men can only fight men as soon as one is eliminated. Like why was Becky standing on the aprons the whole time now is it but you know, I'll just say it but could not mic the mic and they're fucking with you. Fucking with you. You got some heat or something, right? It's I will say I will say not all over the headlines tomorrow. I will say just so that everyone just so that it's not all bad the stuff that obviously one Rollins and undried a was in the ring was of course, really really good. We're talking like yes 100 a and Rollins was in there. I love their work and as Lena Vegas also in kind of amazing everyone involved. His good. It's all just everything surrounding it. That's sometimes confusing. What about Shane McMahon and Drew McIntyre going around trying to find a partner for Roman Reigns and then they did the whole when it was weird. I mean I kind of liked it but I was like then it just like there was a weird way to finish it. Yeah that that angle is tried and true and wrestling but part and parcel to its success is like the face is getting one over on the heels. You know, when they think it's just some asshole janitor. Cedric Alexander has some pretty fucking hands because when ice when I was waiting to figure out who what I was looking at the hands, I'm like, those are some night. That might be a woman in there. I fucking dog hands up. That's hilarious. Yeah. Well, I'm just trying to figure out right but it just it's it puts him in such a weird position to come out he gets the shy and doing all this, you know high-flying offense and then he still loses almost dead. Yeah. It's like, all right. We'll try it on over. Lee fine, but if he loses then nobody's gonna care who's underneath the mash weird if he'd come out I think if he had come out gotten a quick flash pin on Shane and you know, like they go off the air being Furious because it was funny. Yeah, like yeah, it would not have hurt anything know if I can especially if Roman was a big part of the reason why it happened, right? Yeah exactly that what it would not hurt Shane and I would have helped Cedric right quite a bit. Not that that hurt like that helped him a bit, right? For you it just for this for the for the sake of the segment. Hmm. Like I would rather saw the one of those guys get beat. Of course one of those guys mean and on the other team, right and our dreams. Yeah. Exactly. All right, it's Karis mask, right? What the fuck do we think? I mean that's got to be so like okay, it's not that Make a deal right here in the States but like some people don't take that shit like and that's the thing. Am I reading into it too much to think that they that might have been a shot at Del Rio kind of like, I don't know. Who knows. Who knows. How do you guys feel about the drink dinner time? So one time they were doing this thing in the Attitude Era we're fuckin big turkey known has brought in Mexican stars, and they did this thing called super Astros. Yeah. I remember that night and so one time Antonio de Santo is and I knew him from you know, Japan and everything. So I was familiar with them. I don't think anyone else really too many people there knew him, but you know that they talked about how you know serious they were about those masks. Right and Santo was in the in the cafeteria eating without it on hmm, which like usually it's like home. Are you doing abs so fucking Brian Christopher's crazy-ass goes into his bag puts his mask on and walks into fucking catering. What's not then, you know, he didn't make a big deal out of it, but right, you know, yeah. Buddy cut of yeah. Yeah, you wanted that one a gun over to outfit if he would have done that in Mexico, right? Exactly. So, all right. So you mentioned the Drake man Drake 24/7. How do you feel about that? What the third Jake Maverick thing with his wife and the whole the 24 second title videos on that but we got to be careful. We don't want to be you know, like it can go from being enjoyable to too much right? It's like they can hit a point of diminishing returns real quick. Yeah. Really explains like why he went back like he could have gone on his honeymoon where and that was one of the things is like, why are you going if you're trying to avoid everyone, where are you going to the city that Roth happened? I didn't like the what fell flat was the be alone with my baby tonight. That's a like who is this? Who is this who wrote that as much as I love that song? Yeah, but I wasn't buddy I got right here. He goes in there. I was just trying to be a good soldier right fuck. Alright, let's talk about Ricochet Gallows and Ricochet versus Karl Anderson. And then basically AJ coming in into attacked Ricochet afterwards in the club and all of that was fun. Hmm. Say that again. I mean I would have liked that. I like the fact that both gallons and Anderson. I think just a week after we're trying to resolidify Galas and Anderson as a serious threat having him having to run through both the match different. Yeah. It's like I like it. I just would have put the mat I would have I wouldn't have done the match like that right now. I'm not really gonna get all off and no sure it's just how it is. The front and it would have worked better. I don't like the fact that they were like, you know, he had these two they had these two chances and maybe there were better all things being equal and I could do all the amazing shit that ricocheted up. Right? Right. That's all I meant by that and he's and the stuff in the ring is still it's awesome. I love seeing him work with them and kind of that Dynamic but I don't know. Like I said just a week after we're trying to rebuild them as a credible team and as a credible faction. Yeah, I knew that there were I think there are better ways to do it and honestly those for the main points of raw. Other than that we had no way Jose versus Cesaro Cesaro won the Viking Raiders. I can read we have to beat the Clock Challenge to Beat the Clock Challenge Bailey versus Sarah Logan Nikki cross versus data Brooke. Actually thought Bailey versus Sarah Logan was it was a pretty nice match. I just really wish they would do more with Sarah Logan anyone see where Amber moon was going off on Dana Brooke about like stealing like one of our moves and the suplex. Where did this happen? Anyway, so that more Twitter. Yeah, I was on Twitter. We gotta have it under saying many to me. We should have a lot of drama because it looked like just a basic suplex and I'm like, how does anyone have dibs on that? Right? Right, right. So never enough. All right. That's what are we done?

       " \"Simone aka @simonescribes is a self proclaimed makeup, skincare and wine enthusiast. This week she and Orla chat about passions, careers and travel.\\xa0  Hi, I'm Morten Makonnen and you're listening to adulting with friends. So over the course of this podcast. I'm going to be talking to some of my best friends and some of our Islands biggest influencers and I'll be asking them who they were when they were 17 who they are now and why adulting is just so harsh today. I am here with one of my favorite instagrammers ever. She's my go-to when I need to be told. Yes. It's okay to buy any makeup at all.It's Simone scribe. Yay. Thanks for having me. Thanks for coming. It's exciting 12 o'clock. We're drinking Rosie very young brother living the dream. So we're going to talk about adulting. Yeah, you've lived in know the place I have so I'm so interested to hear your thoughts your favorite places here. You're finding living at home again. Yeah, let's not really home, Ireland. Yeah, not home.Yeah, so, okay. Tell everyone what you do know and like a bit of babe you okay? I'm from Galway originally and but I've been living in Dublin for the last two years before that. I lived overseas for 10 years with my husband and my son and we've obviously just come back in the last two years. So we lived in the Middle East for seven years and we lived in Southeast Asia in Singapore for two years before that and for that we were in England, so it's been a bit of a I don't know. It's been a bit of a shock coming home because it's not really home because we're in Dublin and neither of us are from Dublin. So but we're two years in now, so we're getting settled. It's starting to even out a little bit for us. So work-wise. I used to be a makeup artist many many many moons ago, and that's what got me into the beauty industry. And and that's where that all be gone. I started a Blog that's it's still alive, but I have enough time. Started a Blog I think it's eight years old and I are not eight or nine years old. Yeah, so I did that. I worked as a session makeup artist in Singapore and then a little bit of the Middle East and then I went into writing Beauty writing at first freelance and then I just went and house. I was working for Gracia and then I decided I want to stay in publishing long term. So I stayed in that for a few years and then we moved within the Middle East and I ended up working for timeout and I worked for them for a couple of years and at that point. Digital was really starting to pick up in the Middle East is a little bit behind compared to here but it was something I was really into and obviously I'd had the blog for years and I had friends who worked in digital and so an opportunity came up for me to go out on my own and start doing you know copy for website social media management photography and all that kind of stuff. And so that's what happened. I went into that and I've been working for myself and I'll for I would say five years almost what your main lead. Not in the Middle East still or do you do you do that in Ireland? Yeah, I do it in Ireland as well. It depends on the project or if it's a rolling thing or if it's a one-off project. I would work for some people sort of on a rolling basis and then others I might do one month for them or three months or or even just content so I might be approached by a brand who would say we need 30 images of this product or they might want images and copy to go with us or just Depends it's really varied. Right? Yeah, so when you were doing the writing you didn't do journalism though. Did you know I didn't know my degrees in Psychology. So yeah, so it's a lot of obviously there was a lot of writing psychology like, oh my God, all I did was write essays. But yeah, I don't know. I think it's kind of it's in our family like my brother is a journalist. My grandmother was a writer so there is a lot of that. I don't know. I just kind of fell into I've always thanks. Thanks, you know, it was funny. I was showing a post that I did to my mum ages go on Instagram and she says to me. Yeah, you're always very dramatic, you know, and I know and she's like no no even a traumatic writers that I remember when I was in like 5th class or six class. We had to write some essays about something and it was the most dramatic like I was creeping down a hallway and suddenly in the distance. I heard a door creaking and all this like, it's just pure drama, you know, so yeah. I don't know it's always been In our family. So this does a lot of writers on my mom sites. Okay. Did you consider doing journalism? No, not really. No it just kind of yeah, it was it was what I wanted to do for a while. I thought I was going to be a counselor. I thought I'd be great at that. I think I'd be too like, you know, like if it was relationship counseling I'd be like he didn't do that yet. I just don't think I would she like I'm really into human behavior and why we do what we do and I think that's why I thought I would like to do it. But I think ultimately I don't think I have it's a very Niche skill set to be a counselor to be with her. But I just don't think that I have it and really have to divide yourself away. And yeah, so but I always enjoyed the writing and then just because I was in the beauty industry. It kind of just merged into doing a little bit of writing and then more and then more and then mainstream and then yeah and that's what happened. Okay? Okay, so I'm gonna ask you a few questions about your Seventeen-year-old cell go ahead. Okay, so you're gonna answer these. Okay a seventeen-year-old Simone. Okay, first one easy fish. What's your favorite makeup product? You know, I don't know. I think I know when I was 17, there was a lot of rumor. I think there was a lot of room and products but also I have really clear memories of using a lot of meself Rich makeup, you know, the stackable Parts. Yes. Yeah. I used a lot of those. I'd like a metallic like duck egg blue eyeshadow. I still love that. Yeah, so they were my main I don't think we even had highlighters then it was just eyeshadows and it was all cream. It's all cream. Yes. I used a lot of those and I used a lot of room. Oh, I'm pretty sure as well. There was a Max Factor pan stick in there. I think we all use those some point, but just you know, heavy and a lot like Bryce that was my main makeup by back then so did you wear makeup from like Ikuo, yeah like to it was fine. Yeah, I don't know. I think I just broke my parents down. Eventually. They were like just let her off. You know, I remember being in the bathrooms and secondary school before we get the bus home just slathering it on my friend and she a blonde a the ways to be in the bathroom together putting it on our Miss Selfridge docking pots. And I don't know it's just I've always been into it. I yeah, I watched my grandmother and her makeup and my godmothers a makeup artist and so I was always around makeup from a very young age and it just I had this babysitter. I remember when I was really young Jillian and when my parents used to go out I'd be like did you bring your makeup bag? And she said yeah and she's to do my makeup for me. I'm assuming like 11 or 12 or 11 or think or even younger. Oh my God. I still look in the mirror and be like I thought I looked about 20 so great, you know and then we take it off for my parents came home. And yeah, I just I don't know. I've always been really into it not I don't think I was very good for a long time. But the passion was there and what you can into skincare. Yeah, it was a little a bit but not out of kind of passion. It was more out of necessity. Like like I said, my godmother was in the industry and she was actually the first person to give me skincare. She gave me the clinic, you know, the three style. Yeah. Yeah and I use that and she's always say to me like you need to look after your skin and and my mom and my grandmother always used ponds cold cream. And so I kind of just did it. Like I always cleanse tone moisturize but I didn't really understand. Yeah just made us a new Sammi saw them do not and so I don't I think my skincare Obsession came in sort of Early early to mid-20s and when we were driving away, we're in Singapore and I just started get pigmentation and I was started panicking about the Sun and yeah, I cream and like, you know, all this kind of stuff and and I think that's when it really like I'd always use skincare was kind of sporadic like what was it? What was in what was new whatever. Yeah, but I started to really get into it and read about it and I'm just a little bit more than Indian. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. Okay on a weekend. What time do you get up? When I was 17, I was living in Spain. I was actually working as a rep just gas at the time of my life getting someone into it. No. No, I used to work at the airport. Falcon at the time Falcon JWT and then they were bought by somebody else years later and I would and what the hell they are. But yeah, that's what I was doing. So at the time work days, I was up at like 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. Every day. And then we had one day off a week and I don't think I got up basically until nighttime, then we went out and pass it. So yeah very early and then very late on the Joseph. So unwrapping would you have been like the person getting people off the bus and then bringing them to their hotel and stuff? Yeah. We did a lot of those are ya so we had some airports you I swear we just worked in the airport. So we would like Greek flights bring them to whatever coach they were going to and then you might go back into the airport and do it again and do it again and do it again or else you might be the one that also gets on the coach with them and then bring them to the resort and oh my God, I had the best crack like it was just it was just really and I think about it now like I look back and I think I really as a seventeen-year-old like I was not I would never consider myself extroverted or And I definitely wasn't then but obviously like I had to put a balls going on buggered off with 17, like know anyone nobody and how did you even find out about the job? You just saw they did. Yeah, they did some advertising thing in Ireland and I kind of remember where I saw but I remember I had to go up for a big open day. It was Indulgence was a big thing, you know to go from garbage dump the day. Oh my God, I had to get like a new outfit. I think I wanted to Benetton and I got a new shirt. I was wearing a pink shirt or something, but we had to go off and there was a load of girls there. It was 20 or 30 of us and I was just kind of a summer thing. I just thought security fall and I was really bored of being a goal and I always wanted to go away. I was wanted to work overseas always wanted to travel would we've done a bit of traveling when I was a kid and both my parents would have done a good bit of traveling and so it was always kind of in me and I wanted to just you know do stuff do something fun. And so we went up for this big thing and I think they were only recruiting like eight people out of 30 or something. And so we had a group interview and then we had to do a presentation about like we do pick a country. Pick a city and do a presentation on that like the best things to see and do to do so, I picked Cyprus because we used to Holiday lot there when I was little and I remember doing that shaking all the way through but it was it was good. I enjoyed it and then we had a one-on-one interview and yeah ended up getting it. I remember I think my parents were like, yeah sure looked letter off to do whatever and then I got the job and they were like, what do you mean you're leaving? I was like, yeah, I'm going so yes, I went I always remember I vividly remember A landing the airport. I was Puttin me Orca first we were moved around like different parts of Spain but I was putting the Orca. I remember Landing two or three o'clock in the morning. I didn't speak a word of Spanish at the time. I didn't know anybody and there was only one person at the desk of the company I was working for because it was like the graveyard shift and she just said yeah, you have to go outside on whatever coach to get to the office and then you'll get brought to where you're living and what you're doing and I just want to go out and like trying to speak to this Spanish guy who's didn't couldn't understand what I was saying. I know he was saying I just thought my God, what am I doing? Like this was such a mistake and everything, but I got my way around it got there and then I mean over the course of the few years that I did it like I made some unbelievable friends and we're all still in touch now, which is amazing. Yeah, like every he's got married had kids and when I just think back like the absolute crack that we had there was an amazing for more than one Sunday. I did for a couple of summers ago. Did you go back them and go to college? I am no, I did my degree in my 20s. Oh, yeah, so I did all of it back. It's you know, my parents were like she's not very academic. I think she just wants to travel and I was like, yeah, so I went into that Gap. Yeah, I know but big gap here and then when I came back and I was working and I thought about going back to study but I didn't really want to stay in Ireland and then I met my husband and we got engaged and married and then we moved overseas and I thought you know, what now is the time if I'm not going to do it now my 20s and they're going to do it. Yeah, so I studied with the University of Derby and I did my degree took me 5 years. Was really hard. I think harder I had friends who like done degrees who were like commiserating and like supporting me by saying it's much harder to doing it on your own, you know, like your doom really great. Like I found it very difficult, but I did it and so that was it God. Yeah. And when did you meet a didn't Adrian Adrian and I actually met him when I was 16 stop. Yeah, we met when I was really young and go away. He was in university there and I was you know out on the town he was working in the nightclubs. The weekends like as a bouncer and that's how we mesh and then we kind of dated briefly and then I buggered off overseas are two that I was like bye and then we lost touch I didn't see him again. And then I just ended up back at home one. I carry what year it was was good for years later was like maybe five years after we met and I was in my mom's house trying and failing to get on to friends on MSN Messenger who are overseas because that's obviously was all the great. Yeah the time and he He added me I could remember I could remember him and and how long were you dating or Worse were like a few weeks. I know that. Yeah, and yeah, and so we got back in touch and that was it. Wow. Yeah. So what year did you get married? We got married in 2008. So we've been married 11 years. Now. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. I'm an owl one now and I'll a free dress up but from the minute you married you just left Ireland gone would actually left before we got married. We moved to England. And we were there I don't know something came off by think it was so yeah, something came up for him over there for work, and I thought let's go, you know, and we went and we kind of all intentions to stay there. Like we hadn't really thought about going anywhere else and then an opportunity came up in Singapore and we were in Leeds. I think that's where we're living in Yorkshire. We were there about 10 11 months maybe and this came off and we just thought that I guess yeah, so I think at the time it was about a year. Or 18 months certainly away from the massive recession that hit Ireland and everywhere else and we kind of just thought like if we don't go now you knew what was coming. Yeah, and so but it's one of those things we thought we go for two years and sure we were gone for ten. Yeah. And yeah, so yeah. So yeah, so you went to Singapore first then words you go then we went to Bahrain which is yeah tiny little island besides Audi. So we were there for two years absolutely love that like trying all my God absolutely loved it. Yeah. Just I just loved it. Like it was I don't know. I can't even like the the expat Community there is small but amazing. Everybody knows each other knows each other everyone would do anything for you because nobody has family. So all you have is each other. Yeah. I just loved the people. I'd like to buy her any friends. I love the culture. I loved I just loved everything about it. Like it was just brilliant. Yeah, we're there for two years absolutely loved it. And then we left there and we went to Dubai and so we were there for the last stretch before we are. Okay, and you go back to Dubai. I want you to also go anywhere. Yeah, would you live there for the rest of your life though? Probably not. Yeah. No, probably. I will you can't anyway, unless they to you too. But like no I probably wouldn't I would go back and I mean Charlie was born there and I have a lot of grass for a job. I really do but I probably wouldn't I wouldn't be alive thing. I don't think yeah, but yeah, I would go back I would go I would go I would go back to Singapore. I would go back to wearing like I would to know really where was your First out of all of them. Like I I think I liked them. All I think leads was very difficult for us because oh my God, we were so lonely. They're to know anybody we didn't know the city that well and I didn't know it was really hard time for us. We were planning the wedding and all that kind of stuff and it was just difficult and it was nothing exciting about it because obviously it's just like Ireland weather was like nothing exhausted. It's just hard and so like we've been back since like obviously we have family there and stuff and we've been back and it's a great City, but it's not one. I look back with like extreme fondness and think I looks great. We're at Singapore. I loved I absolutely loved I loved wearing and I love to buy it, especially because Charlie was born there. And yeah, so like I like them all I couldn't compare them. Yeah, they're all so different in their own way. Yeah, so, Yeah, I like them all to be answered in a perfect. Yeah, I was in Abu Dhabi but I think because I was crew I had a totally different experience. Yeah for sure Ian's like was I ever sober? Yeah, we still don't know why so memories I've been wanting for Facebook what I like I think because I didn't have like a proper routine or anything. So in my mind, I'm just like I don't know if I could ever live in the Middle East. Properly then I think when people do you have the right routines? I just absolutely love this. Yeah. I mean there is something about I think it's Irish people. We are like affected obviously on some other level by the weather. Yeah, the darkness the clouds the rain and so waking up. I mean this isn't specific to the Middle East obviously, but waking up in sunshine everyday. I just does something to your brain yet, you know, you just get off and you do stuff and you enjoy it you enjoy every part of your day and then you come home you go to bed and you Art it all over again the next day like there is something amazing for us having grown up in this climate living in that kind of climate. Then that's part of the reason I went to Spain when I was young as well because I just couldn't just wanted to get away and have a real summer. I mean, I remember flinging open the shutters in the house. I was living in when I was in Spain, which is thinking Jesus like it was just Blues Guys first. Yeah see amazing and I think that probably affected me when I was so young that I just I mean the weather here really upsets me. I'm just Ran this is nice. It's like doorman is a lot milder though. I have to say like always gets a trophy yet. But yeah, and did you find it hard working in the Middle East? Like did you find that it was different? Not really? No. I mean I was predominantly like I said in publishing and you know, I worked in a big office with a couple of hundred other people and everybody was Irish or Australian or American or English or wherever and it was just a big Melting Pot and everybody was in the same boat because we're all experts. Yeah. And what most of us are experts in those at some people who had well actually no, they were still experts but they've been born and raised in Middle Eastern never left yet. So they've grown up there but their parents were from different countries and whatever but no I didn't it was very normal. It's just very went to work every day did my job callme but like I said, I was in the sunshine and okay sometimes extreme uncomfortable. So I am I was still sorry we met when we were really odd. I just remember being like appreciate it. Appreciate this so cute. I'm gonna go like, oh my God. Your insights just little stuff and to me like it's crazy. I know it's on it's on it's great. Yeah Bush know I find it very normal very easy. It's a real. I mean, especially Dubai like they are, you know, very open-minded and open to international business and the infrastructure is just amazing for business. So no it was great. I had a great time there. Yeah. Yeah. I must go back but I think I'll need a while before I can feed get I think it's been like two years since I came back and I'm like, I need another two and then maybe I'll give it a go and see. Okay. This is an interesting one. Most expensive thing. You've bought. Okay, when I was 17 the most expensive thing. I bought it was probably my CD player to be honest really like I was really into my music. Yeah time and I had a cassette Walkman, you know, we all had those. Yeah, and then after a while I remember CDs came in and so then I bought a CD player that had little speakers and I used to bring it with me like when I traveled and stuff. So I think that was the most expensive like the fact that I remember buying it usually at that age isn't it to ya cause me a lot of money but at Hearst so yeah, I would say that's that was my most expensive thing. And what would you have been listening to? Oh God boys. Men, really got Boys to Men Snoop Dogg the Goo Goo Dolls. Oh God Limp Biscuit Boyz II Men thing actually was hilarious because at the time for some reason we couldn't get Boys to Men here or they didn't have certain albums or whatever. Anyways ranking on the ground. So Oh my god father lived in Los Angeles at the time and he used to get them for me and post them. Oh my God is to just make my own tooth do that. Yeah, we mustn't be together suppose that they maybe they weren't that big. I remember like Nsync and stuff. I'd be like, please Bruno and thank God they were big as well. I meant they came to Dublin. I think when I was in in six cars or fifth class or was it Backstreet Boys one of them. Anyways, I remember people were just losing it because they were coming to Jonathan's freaking out. But yeah, I know I had very eclectic. Music tell you so but I always had music on and so that's why I got the CD player, right? Yeah, which you've got two cakes and stuff. No, not really. No. It wasn't a real. I'm still not one of those really know even if like, I don't know even if one of my favorite artist or something like that, I just I'm not a gig person. I don't like concerts. Okay. I just have never been like that. And then I think when I once or twice I did like for example, I've been a huge life. Long fan of Busta Rhymes Like enormous. Okay worship. I don't know huge fun. And when we were in the Middle East I was working for time out. He was coming to Dubai for a gig and the night life and culture editor said to me. It's actually yeah, he said to me do you want to go and interview him because obviously you're you're the fan like no. No, I'm so excited. Yeah and Just a disaster like the P or was ringing me saying he's not up. He's asleep. He's something else. He was busy doing something else and then she couldn't get hold of him or something. And then I was supposed to go before the gig to interview them and then she rang me and said can you come after the gig and no later later on and I said, okay and I was just waiting and waiting and waiting and then eventually I went and I was waiting to just be let off because he was staying in the penthouse to do the interview and she said, I'm sorry. He just his manager said he's too tired. You just want to do it. And I thought my God. Okay. And so I thought well, you know this these things happen. Yeah, so I went to the gig we were in the club from like 11. I had my friend with me and he was supposed to be on stage at 12 the Club closes at 3:00. He came out of 20 past to onto the stage where and we were stood right in front of it was only small stage and it was just the worst gig it was awful. What's that saying? Like never meet your Idols or whatever? Yeah, it was he had a deejay. Who essentially carried the load of the concert on his shoulders he just did most of the work like pasta just kind of stood there paced up and down with his drinks and he kept like cursing and roaring. Like let's get fucked up and this kind of stuff but he didn't he didn't do much. That's what you've been doing all day and like half an hour and I just thought oh my God, this is the end devastated. I know so we left we left already. It was just not great and and they kind of ruined it for me. Yeah, and then I went with friends to see Drake he was in Dubai. Yeah, so same thing like it just wasn't that busy. I think they'd picked an auditorium or a stadium or whatever. That was too big. Anyway, right up here though. He is obviously massive. It was only I'd say 1/3 full and everybody around these big over there. Everybody went down like to the, you know, not the pattern, you know the bit that's not it's right in front of the stage. Yeah, and we because we're old women we stayed in the stands and youth are it was just just not great. Yeah like it just and you know, obviously the dawn of the internet we see people all the time on YouTuber concerts and With the trailers and then suddenly you're at a concert and you see him come out and he does the same things that you saw him doing YouTube and you're like, oh no and after that I just thought well, I'm not gonna do this anymore. Like I just don't enjoy I'm actually at Coachella. Okay sheís really was the worst person ever got yes. Yeah. It was just the worst sass right? So obviously, he's just not good life. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know it was yeah, so I don't as a real now and the thing is in Joplin, obviously, there's loads of great Gates and all three are just come here, but I just would never I know just wouldn't I just it's not me. I just wouldn't go you know and the Todd of like oh my God queuing I'll stop after that. Okay. What is number one on your bucket list? When I was 17, I think I kind of had achieved it. I wanted to live overseas like I wanted to go and live away and I did that and when I was way I never really wanted to do anything else. Like I didn't really have a yearning to go home or yeah. I just wanted to live away and I did it and so that was my thing. I really like I feel like when I look back when I was 17, I really lived in the moment. You know what I mean? I think when were as we get older were cursed with like Progressing and like doing more and saving and what are we gonna do next and you're constantly thinking like ahead and planning because you have to you know, especially when you have kids and things like that, but when I was 17, I feel like I lived every day that day. Yeah, and I never thought about what I'm going to do. What are we to do, you know made no worries. You were just so now I've got all just so that my bucket list was to live away and I did do that what I'm seventeen's yeah. Let's go me achieved. Nothing. Great your prized possession. Was it the CD player? Oh God when I was 17 my prized possession. Let me think about that. Yeah, I probably like my seat either my CD player my CD Walkman. I'm just trying to think like what was in my room my makeup things like that? No, I didn't really I was probably just my CD walk when I didn't really we didn't have computers or anything then like I stole to an internet cafe to send emails even yeah. I like I didn't have the none of us had laptops like that worked that time. I think our bosses did obviously but it wasn't a thing like none of my friends had laptops or anything. So no, I think yeah, the biggest thing I used to track around with me was my CD Walkman and were you in the city? Or were you kind of well when I was 17, I was in Spain for most of us watch. No. I mean go away. I am from like six seven miles outside the city. Okay, push. Yeah. No, I was thinking when I was in Spain, that's a but even when I was in goal is the same as the CD Walkman. That's the thing. I used to slap around with me. Like I yeah, I mean I think about it like there was belts then that you could get to like poke your CD Walkman on it. Remember people in shop Street like with their CD Walkman. Isabel on their belt and I be like, wow that looks like every new model, you know, like I saw someone today wearing that though. I wouldn't even blink. I'd be like they work in Urban Outfitters. Yeah retro stuff, but that was the thing like it was you just had this enormous piece of gas like your CDs stop. Yeah. I remember one of my friends we used to go drinking in a field and it's called hole in the wall. So it's kind of all okay, I'm 15, and we'd all just be sitting there next thing. He just walked through. Huge field and you'd see the boom box before you feel my God like an enormous. There's like a weapon of - yeah, there's no need we've speakers. I know we have uh, this is totally unnecessary. Oh God the Boombox. I forgot about those. Yeah, you're such a thing. Yeah that used to it with date name and the house party and stuff as I was slowly whipped out. I mean there was no only until things are enormous. Can someone help me lift, like clubs and stuff in go away. Were you like into like nightlife for? I don't know. Yeah, like as a rule. I think that's just what you did you went. You know, we were all aflutter about which bars and clubs would be able to get into because we're underage we had some gas fake IDs back in the day like just I had like a German work permits that a friend of mine had given me because we Look the same and so her name was grandia. She was like here you can have it. I'm like thanks. Nice to be like Hi, here's my fake ID. Yeah, I'm girl. Yeah and always like a friend would let the cat out of the bag but like roaring I you in the queue like Simone you forgot your and I'm like sure. Yeah, but you still turn around and you're like, hey Ian. Yeah, but now we just did it. I think at that age like when I think back we had the best night out at that age because the majority of us were underage. Yeah, especially in Galway like there's some great bars and clubs and so If you've got in the beginning of the night, oh my God, you just knew it was going to be good night because sometimes you just wouldn't get in and then if you'd had success in the Brewers, of course you had to carry on. Yeah and the night always ended in the nightclub. There was no going home after the barriers when you were 16 17. Yeah, so we would always end up in whatever and I killed will take us and always on a real for a night out though. Yeah. Well, it was also good amazing ways to go to like three or four pubs and then we knew all the ones to go to to get the free stamp into the nightclub, you know. Get a free stamp in before 12. We didn't care. What was the one on the Square? It's definitely still there. There's a queue mope to the back of it then it's some bar. Oh God, the state has changed names so many times now there was there was the alley I don't know what that's called know. There was Cuba which is also changed names. There was like Boo radleys and CPS and was a big one. I don't know what it's called. Now. I've been there so many times but it was just one of those places they would let you yeah, I'm Ryan. Yeah didn't give a shit. They always knew you'd Rock off at like 10:00 to midnight when the camp was empty and they'd be like, oh here they are. You know you yeah, they knew you were underage or close enough to it anyway, but we didn't care. You know, like when you're older you like God, you know, we're not going to go wherever until later because there'll be no crack, you know, but when you're young you just don't care you go and you make your own crop, but first thing and not the other day there was the palace on Camden serese if you went before 11:oo Godfrey in like it was only a tenant, but we were so poor 10 or was enormous tool. So, you know now if someone said to me Oh, no my Des. Yeah be in town for half ten. Yeah, like I'll be getting out of the shower then like I won't be in town told half. Well, I know it's so funny, isn't it? You do. Well, I just broke ya want to trick you just drink at home and yeah or drink in somebody's house and then go out and but it's honestly the best time yeah, I don't think I ever I Rarity remember having a bad night then because we were just so delighted to be able to be served when we went to know. Yeah, that's funny when I went to Canada. I was 18 and I only went through like four days my friends were over there and the night before they were like, by the way, the drinking age is 19 here. Yeah for fuck's sake I didn't have any idea. My sister had given me one I'd lost it. So I was like, she's not gonna give me another so I rang my friend and she was like, I have a fake ID, it's fine. She's likely the only thing is is that you'll have to be Pakistani. You could make it. Let's give it a go. Oh my God. I know I looked up and the guy just looked at me and looked at the idea and he just laughed he was like, yeah God, I think he's just really voice of person like he was just like this is clearly not yell, but work to charge. I know the thank you f sharp. Yeah. Okay. What perfume do you wear? Okay. I know this one's super well because I wore the same over years. I wore YSL baby doll. It was in it was a motive is a little pink kind of not a bottle. It was one of those flasher. I can't even describe it just like a flasher shape round but last lap lower very if I remember very like vanilla musk, you know, that was a bit like Angel remember you Like that. So yeah, I used to wear that I was at I work for years. I used to buy it any time. I was in Judy free or like in Galway. They had the perfume shop think that was yeah that was all the rage for because he's fighting there. Yeah. So that was the perfume I were like religiously for years and stubble with any no loved it. Really. I absolutely loved it. It's my signature scent. Yeah. I just really like that. I'm only gonna wear that I know such Notions. Yeah, yeah. That was my that was my favorite one. I wouldn't fear away from my side baby Jonah Greeley and I sense your thing. Like would she be reading into greetings sir? No, I mean I'm still very set in my way even know and I would I have a few different ones but I always have one always the same one because I just love it. I yeah for years. I was kind of the same then like I would probably try or you know, when you're younger is why people would always get you perfume presents when you're young examine teen 18 and I would probably use them but I would always go back to Baby John. Yeah, it's just one of those. Like to add to this doll Maker's I don't know. Actually, I actually don't know if they do. I certainly haven't seen it for a long time. But maybe you can still buy it online. I don't know. Yeah, there's one. What is it? There is a website where you can get like discontinued. Perfect. Okay, right and like I mean, yeah 15 Euro Earth my God, you get them so cheap but they were so expensive as well as especially because we were so young like it was you know, but yeah if I bought the rearview mirror, but even now what kind of kills me to buy perfume because I'm like it is still awesome. Yeah. I try and only by the majority for you to be honest. Yes lie because I just couldn't justify wandering into like BT's and buying and it's overwhelming as well. It is yeah, I'm gonna have a look Ray. Yeah, I know. So yeah, I think it's easier to cope with when you know, you want a specific one. You might didn't buy it and leave whereas if you start browsing your like everything's a hundred quid. What is your biggest worry? My biggest worry when I was 17. Oh my God. I don't know. I don't know what my biggest worry. I don't think I had any I don't think I was very chilled and children were here at college or anything like that. No, no because I'd suck that off. I was not going, you know, Dad you just decided traveling? That's it. That's it. I'm just gonna go away and and my mom was very supportive. I remember she was like look universities and for everyone if you want to work that you can work. Yeah, like she I think my mom's very like me her her parents made her go to university so she went but she didn't she never wanted you to I wanted to work so I knew I was kind of like my mom like that and so she was like look if you want to go travel and then come back and get a job and do what you want to do then great. And so I think that if that hadn't happened, yeah, maybe I would have had other worries. I would have been more insecure like what I'm going to do my life and yeah, but no I didn't I was very my mom was great. Like she just said if this what you want to do and I knew when I went away That she was upset that I've gone and she must be nothing but she would never show it. Yeah, I wanted to support me. She wanted me to do what I do when I think want to stop you from know and I think about that now like as a Mom myself now, I don't know how she did it. You know. I just want to hold my child to me forever never leave home, but she was great. She was like you have to do what you want to do and figure out who you are. And and so I think around that time I was generally pretty Carefree. I didn't have no worries because I was doing what I wanted to do. Did you think you were really grown up and Why? Yeah, I think I was quite independent. Anyway, I'm yeah pretty independent and going away. Like I said, it was a bit nerve-racking but it wasn't enormous stretch for me. I just really wanted to do it. And so I don't know. I just it's just mad when I think about it like how headstrong I was then yes because I didn't have a lot of worries. We don't anyways, most of us, you know, when we're if we're lucky like at that age. You don't really they're not real worried now. No things that are never, you know, you live in your mind. It's just it's you know, I'm really glad like that. I lived my best life then I guess I'm to one of my friends but that she actually lives in Kuwait now, but we work together overseas. Okay when we were young and we were talking about it and I was saying God, I'm so glad we live the lives we did then because that's what it's all about because then you get older and then you've got the responsibilities and then the worries and everything coming up that's life. And so I'm really glad we had that life because I know some people don't and they do have worries that age and you know, obviously then they grow up and it gets worse. And yeah, so I'm glad that we had no cares completely heedless more like, but anyway, were you ever like were you sensible but money? Yeah, I would I would say like 95% of the time I was sensible. I remember one time I had to call my parents and ask them for money because I'd run out and they were just appalled and all I wanted was something like 50 euros until it was a couple of days. Or payday, you know and I just remember like I was so wounded by how disappointed they were. I swore I was like it's never gonna happen again and didn't after that. Oh my God. I wish I was pretty good. Right? I was just really focused on like this is my money for food that he be alive. And then this large portion is for my alcohol. That was my budgeting, you know? Yeah, and then this little bit as for Miss Selfridge and like buying my few bits or wasn't boots. What was it? There was a big chemists we used to go into In Galway camera, it was boosted by my bits in there and it's not as pretty good when the last I was pretty good. So I was woefully by the way I've set up a nightmare. Working underneath break and she was like a grounds but looking back it was because I'd started drinking. I was like, they're giving me I was only working four hours on a Sunday. That was it looking back. It was just because I was like, I'm too hungover. Yeah, sounds like so bad. Yeah, and then she just did for me out money. Yeah poor thing. I know I'm going to be a dick at home. I'm going to be like I fuckin know the sauce here. I know you're well then I know yeah. Yeah, I'm so bad. But anyway, I've kind of learned kinda not can I have that Vault? Where will you be in 10 years? I think when I was that age, I thought I thought I would be living away. I thought I would be living overseas. I would be somewhere I would not be in Galway. I would not probably even be in Ireland. I would be away somewhere not not knowing specifically what I would be doing, but I just always had a feeling that I would be living overseas doing something because I just never I do know I never wanted to stay in Galway. Yeah, you know, I just I always remember when we're doing our leaving cert. I just couldn't wait to get out. I just couldn't wait to go. All somewhere. Yeah and was Dublin ever not ready? No not running. I just wanted to go away area something else. I wanted to travel and just why did I just wanted to like do something new and cool. And so I think yeah, it's 17. I think if you'd said to me we're going to be 10 years, I would say overseas. Yeah, I no idea where or what I'd be doing but away Adrian always want to go overseas as well or was it just a work thing? Yeah. He led you to he had lived overseas himself on and off when We'd met and even when he was a teenager like he'd worked away a few Summers and I think anyway, like most people I know at home. We you know, it's kind of enough. So I think it's Irish people like we all do stuff. We all travel we all have people who've gone to Australia or Canada and states or family who have emigrated or whatever, but I know it's kind of the done thing now, it's very you have to take the year at some point. Yeah. I'm not sure when you do it, but but yeah, he suppose we're quite like minded like that. So he liked traveling and doing new. - so did I and so just kind of wasn't a big thing when something came off and we started to live away. It was like yeah cool. Let's do it. Whereas obviously like I remember telling my mom we're moving to Singapore and she was like, where's that I know but where it's gonna take me 24 hours in a flight and I'm like no, it's only 12. Yeah. Did she go? Yeah. She did she come out a few times. Yeah, but it you know people at home and they say just the shock of a yeti mean why but it's nice when you move away because then your parents actually go then Because of visits things and yeah, you know and yeah, it was great like oh God excitement when somebody was coming to visit as well. I was just oh my God. Yeah, we'd be there like none of us could come. Yeah Darby and we'd all be like, right. We'll have a roast. Let's show that we're actually doing okay everybody wash. Did you not find it hard though? I haven't Charlie on your own with just the tube. Like I know you had friends and everything. Yeah, but like being in a different. Country without scare me so more. Yeah it let mean I know on paper it was very hard. But I think when you're in a like we certainly didn't have time to think. Oh my God poor us. I can't believe this is happening to us. I can't believe we're here and we've no family and we just got on with it. I can certainly wasn't what I had envisaged. I had. I mean we were supposed to not be in Dubai in the first place just work and different things have changed. We ended up going to divide the last minute. I was supposed to To have Charlie in Bahrain. I had my guy knee and the hospital and I my mom was supposed to fly out the week or two weeks before he was born and it just all went wrong. Like we ended up in a different place different hospital. My mom broke her foot a few days before she was due to fly out. She could come out and so this like series is chain of events occurred in the home. So you must have been like, yeah, we just yeah, but it was weird because I mean you really do just go into this. You know, it's fight or flight like you just go into survival mode. Like this is what it is. I was very aware of, you know, the impact of stress on babies and this kind of stuff and so I was very calm and we just got on with it and we had him and I had him in the hospital by it was just the two of us and my husband had to go back to work like straight away. Like there was no he just started his job. And and so we were just alone and you know, but but the thing is when I say these things like I don't I don't know having a baby any other way. Yeah, you don't know what a difference that's just yeah. I know I can talk to people or read in a magazine or whatever about people having their kids with their family around this and I think I was not nice, but I have no experience of that. So, I don't know. I don't have I don't have any other you don't have regret or jealousy or Castle just like because I don't visit it is what it is. That's what happened. You know, we did our best I think obviously when things like that happen to people there's a lot of benefits in that you become very You know tough and you're able to do whatever and you just get on with it and obviously there's a lot of downsides as well. But like I don't know I think we just we were brilliant when I get back like we just flew through it and we did what we had to do and I remember like when my mom came out, I think the first time she met Charlie he was six months. I think the first time she could find I remember she was very upset because my best friend had been out before her to see awesome and you know, just the way it was and I remember any show my best friend saying to me like your poor mom. She's so upset. She brought over stuff for me for my mom. - I know but you're not this is life. Yeah, it's just it is what it is. You'll see him at six months. He's like no need to reach out and he didn't know it was fine. It was fine. And you weren't working that because you just moved over. Yeah. I'm sorry leave was Grand. I had gone we were living in Bahrain and I was working for grazia the time and I got a maternity leave like people do and I had planned to go back at whatever point and then we moved we We left we're hurrying and we ended up in Dubai and I thought my God like because nothing went to plan. Basically we weren't supposed to be where we were and nothing was turning out. Right? And so I had to go back to work. I think three and a half weeks after he was born or four weeks after he was born and that was hard. Just trying to do childcare and like in a city that we didn't really know like when we were in Bahrain we used to visit to buy but it was like for fun, you know, yeah, he would go over for a night out or to see friends or do something but almost yeah. Yeah ever. Yeah, it wasn't like normal life stuff. So yeah, I had to go back to work very early and that was kind of hard but in another way, you know again, we just got on with it. Like I never remember sitting and thinking this is so unfair. There's no other option than to do upstairs. Yeah, you know, I certainly never remember thinking like God. I wish we weren't here. I wish we were at home or I wish I had my mom or I wish you know, it just it just was what it was and we just got to stay strong. I would be in self-pity mode. Stopping people on the screen now, but the thing is you have a tiny baby. Yeah, and so you just really it sounds cliché, but you really don't have time. You just don't have time like he has to nap two or three times a day has to be fed needs to be changed and you're worried all the time about you know, is he sick as he would temperatures if you go here and there and you just don't have time. Yeah, you know you sleep when you can and you try and look after yourself and and that's it. I could just that just became normal. And so yeah. Yeah, but it's funny like I I suppose when I hear myself sometimes like I talked about this on a different podcast like a couple of months ago and I remember to sit back and thinking kind of such a hard-ass like the way I was saying it like it was fine. You know, of course there was times where I was upset and things like that, but we just didn't have any other. Yeah way to go about I suppose it was like the long time ago Naomi that it you kind of, you know, yeah, it does feel I mean I do remember obviously, I remember everything very clearly, but it's not something that You look back differently now. Yeah, it just it's just one of those just a stage of our life that we went through and then that was it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Jesus no smell into the deep strawberry you ever think you're like your mom Jeffrey like do stuff in your like? Oh jeez. Oh, yeah all the time really all the time. Yeah. I love it though. If I ever do things I'm gonna call that so my God's Not not hear myself say something or I'll do something, but see my mom like, you know, it's funny. Younger you're like I'm not gonna be like my parents was going to be my own person. Whatever. It's just crap. You just can't get away from it. It's your DNA guys. I mean it's you know, but the older I got the more I appreciate my mum and the way she you know just gets on with stuff, you know, like she's had some tough things happen to her as well and she just gets on with that. She's just a real she's a person that does very well in a crisis. It's just great for that. She's really she is there she is helping She is the person that you can ring off at any time of the day or night and say this has happened. Yeah, and she just is brilliant like that. That's just how I told her she's coming at Ya, so I think I have a little bit of that. Yeah, just in terms of what happened with us from your way and having charity and everything kind of learned that for my mom. I think it was probably in me, but I didn't know I had it or that I would have to utilize it. Yeah, but you do because you learned it from somebody else and so yeah as I've got older like I'll hear myself saying I think we're doing something and I think my God, that's exactly what my mother would have. Yeah, but now I like it. Yeah, I don't think I could ever I notice things I'm like, oh, that's actually I like that. Yeah, you know, yeah, she did a good job. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Yeah go moms, but she loved you to go back to go away. Yeah, probably I mean, you know, we love God we both of us because you know, I grew up there Adrian spent a lot of time there and it's such a cool City. We've all got friends there. Obviously. My mom is there and my brother is there and Charlie loves going back and It's a lovely city. I would like to think at some point that I would live there again. Yeah, I don't know when that'll be maybe it never happened. I've no idea but I mean, yeah, she would love if we were back there. I would love it. I know I would love being back there. I don't know for how long but I don't think we've been away for so long. Now. They've everybody's just used to us not being, you know not being around or you know, yeah, we're moving here now or I Grange like ever next I think they've just got I think she'd be really surprised if I notice you're moving back. Yeah, we should be delighted but she would like no way it's a nice Retreat for now is yeah, it's like oh, I love it. Yeah, and especially in the summer. There's no place like going somewhere. It's magical the countryside in general. I know in this anywhere near I could be welcomed any time the sun is shining and I'm like, isn't this great gorgeous. We get a bit of sun Austin Tickler son starved here. That's the problem. Okay, so I'm going to ask you the same questions, but now answered. Oh great. Eight and got the time very juicy. So your favorite makeup product. Okay. I was thinking about this earlier so I would say now my favorite product being sensible like a Fail-Safe always have it not particularly glamorous, but something I would use every single day is my Bobbi Brown corrector my under eye corrector really I've used it for years. I would say over 10 years. Now. I never don't have a I always have us I bought it everywhere. We've been I just think it is incredible. Like if I only had one minute in the morning, I would slap that on and a bit of mascara. Because it's just fantastic and I can't be can't be duplicated. Still nothing. I've tried other ones. Yeah, I've tried the Charlotte Tilbury one, which is good. But still a bit oilier. Where's the Bobbi Brown was tiny bit dryer and I think that's kind of why you need so it will stay where it is, but I always found like even years and years and years and years ago when I was working as a makeup artist a lot of women that I would work with really didn't need concealer. They were using concealer because they were trying to cover blue veins under their eyes or a shadow in a corner. Yeah. Whereas a lot of the time if you Use a corrector that does the job for you. Yeah, I guess Jan Cedar is then kind of like I would use consider for kind of General brightening and stuff like that. I use consider every day, but the corrector is my failsafe free. Oh, yeah, I think they're phenomenal you have you tried the Becca under eye corrector know that's really nice, but I haven't used the the Bobbi Brown one. So, I don't know if this is pink, right? Yeah, the one I have kind of kind of pink salmon color. I don't know if you'd like it actually because it's a bit more oily early. Yeah, I Draw your one Leap. I said, I think it's made more to mix with the concealer. Okay, maybe yeah, I might give that one a go. Now there's obviously different shades concealer on me. There's a couple of different shades. And so there are all independently to correct different things. So if you have like blue tones or yellow tones or like purplish red tones, so there's a different one to counteract each tone. So I've always had like blue toned Shadows or blue tone veins under my eyes. So I have this Salmon colored it's called light to medium bisque and that just kind of cuts through it and then brilliant. It's just fantastic. That's my that's the product future. I really wasn't expecting that. Yeah, I know be very sensible here getting are getting all the cheese today. Okay on a weekend. What time do you get off bus and seven half six seven. I have a child, you know, this is still guys. Oh wait, I'm a mom. Yeah, exactly. That's my life now and I can't like even if I'm away for work or if I'm away in a friend's or would I my body will not show you sleep in no. So even on a normal day. Maybe we have seven I might sleep in until just yeah like normal days like weekdays I get up at 6:00 a.m. 6:00 6:30 a.m. And then weekends, you know Charities are alarm clock. So he gets up at 7:00 most of the times we would at the weekends we would get off at 7. Our Christmas is he like upper the crocodile? Yeah, he would be I don't know. He's a good sleeper. Like I mean, I know when I was little I couldn't sleep like when Santa was coming and stuff like that are saying this fuckin Charlie is I don't know. He's great like that. Like we tell him he's very excited, but I think he gets so excited. He just wrecks himself until he goes to sleep with her. So yeah, so I get up at 7:00. I used to change the clock and my mom's alarm clock. Okay, I changed it back in a hour and then I would hide it under her bed. Oh my God, you are evil. I had a bear. Oh my God, so my grandparents used to say in those ring the bell and I had a son like I was weird to be and I'd wring it in my grandparents years get up. I wish It was a rainy day remember that period of our lives and we were kids like she was nothing like the best day of your lawyer. I know I know. Okay. What is the most expensive thing? You've bought? The most expensive thing I bought okay. It's either a pair of shoes or handbag. I don't know. I'm just trying to remember how much each of them were. I think the most expensive thing I've ever bought it was an Alexander wine bag. It's the Rocco. So the bigger one with the studs on the bottom. I think it was I got it in. I got it from that report a a camera for those are saying or if I'd a discount call, but I certainly know I didn't pay full price for a blast. A couple of hundred Euro. Yeah, but I still have it. Obviously. I bought it like five years ago. Now I think and I still love us I still keep it in the dust bag. So it's yeah, it's really maintained itself. So yeah, I think that was the most expensive thing and would you be into splurging on one-off items? Are you more like I don't know. I think like I definitely have a few really nice pieces like a couple very nice bags and some nice shoes, but I'm I'm really about quality over quantity like I handbags for example, like I remember when mansoureh gavriel first came out a couple years ago. They were real kind of cool small brand and they had these amazing totes these giant like bucket type totes and a lot. I've always loved big tan leather bags that you can just throw all your shit into your laptop and everything and I wanted to get one and so I bought One because I knew it would be I just knew it would be good quality because it was real leather. Anyway. Yeah, and I can't have the time. It was like it was it wasn't it wasn't as expensive as they are now because I bought it way when they first came out like maybe three or four years ago now and it was a couple of hundred Euro the to 300 Euro Best Buy ever still have us. I wear it almost every day anytime. I have my laptop with me it goes in that. Yeah and the rest of the year or the other, you know throughout the rest of the time. I don't buy bags like I would never just go Browsing and looking at bags. It's always very kind of purposeful. So the man's her gavriel was probably my last big purchase. I remember I bought a clutch couple of years ago as well from there to Port A from Clare V. I don't know if you've heard. I'm sure she's amazing clutch bags and it's a leopard print fold over like a soft clutch. I got it in the sale. I remember it was reduced to like a hundred fifty Euro. Oh my God, that is the only color choices and I go out. Really? Yeah, so I'm really like the bags I think are great. Investment. So do I agree? They will always fixed your car chassis under it's real leather and everything. They will last forever especially if you you know, if you look after them as best you can like if you keep them in their dust box, you know, if you can they will last and they kind of look better I think as they get older yeah as well, you know, so I mind I'm always like I'll buy that Chanel because when I passed into my dad was an area that's a different mic. Have a like the last bag. I think I bought was. Two years ago. I wanted the monster gavriel the bucket bags. The mini ones a black one. I wanted a black cross over bag because I didn't have one and so I bought that and brown hummus and that's the other one that I would wear. If I'm not wearing the big man's bags. I word. Yes, and they wear really well different their bit different. Yeah. So yeah, I would be very kind of strategic. I would want a specific type of bag that I know I would use regularly and so I would buy a really good one. You because think about us. Yeah, and I would think about it and because there's no point like a normal or younger you'd buy bags here and there he buys from Topshop you but I'm here and then after a couple months you've been there you buy another one and then if you add it up the money we spent it would might as well hang on and bought because we didn't think like that. When were younger it just you know, but now I would never like I never just buy a bag. I just I'm happy with the ones I have and I think they're all you know doing a purpose right now. And so yeah. Okay, so that that was probably I think the most expensive one was the Alexander Wang on that I bought About five years ago and it's nice to say that you have one. Yeah, I'm nice to be mad spit out there like this rose gold studs at the bottom of it. Like it's a real kind of yeah, but that's kind of why I like him. It's kind of cool. Yakyaz for different and and I love it. It's a great big hunk of a bag like it's got a big cross body strap and but yeah, it was it was worth it. Yes worth it. Okay. Yeah. What's number one on your bucket list nail? Gosh, I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but it's Travel hold still yeah. Yeah. I really like lived away. We lived away for so long on the other side of the world. Yeah, but I really want to travel around this side. Okay, like I've never been Scandinavia. I really want to go I'd love something. I want to go to Sweden. I wanna go to Denmark want to go to Norway. I want to go. I want to go to Switzerland. I want to go to Iceland like there's so many places. I want to go that we never we've never been to like when we lived in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. We did enormous amount of traveling. Went to Australia we went to Thailand and we went Indonesia and Malaysia and we went all over the Middle East and it was fantastic and I loved it. But now that we're in Europe. I want to do more here. Yeah, so that's my and also the state's I would like to get to the states as well. Like I was there when I was a kid good few times, but I haven't been back in adulthood really know. Yeah, and I've never been to New York, which is like a crime. I all my experience in the States was on the west coast so we had family still. Some family living in Los Angeles. And so that's where I would have gone. Yeah, but I've never been to these coasts. I think I take it for granted because I'm there like is your crew. I see it as a like the airport code. Yeah this TV. I'm like, oh that didn't know. You know, my cousin actually is a pilot and he's on that roof. Yeah, he does that he's coast and like every time we don't like where were you this week? He's like glass in Chicago and then I was in New York and I'm gonna wear you. Mr. Yang. Like I can't even get over like a weekend but It's just planning and like getting organized and but yeah, that's that's my book at this now is to do more travel this side of the world States and you've anything booked or anything at the moment. Not really. We're always bit last minute like depends on you were very now stuck into the school calendar. Yeah and sort of when he's this and that midterm breaks and whatever so and then it depends on work and so you kind of have to wait till all those things Collide to go actually with three days here or yeah, and so and that's how we usually roll So and it's fine. It suits us. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. What is your prized possession? My prized possession is this ring so you can't see it because I'm on the podcast but I said, what a great meeting so delighted you fighting me on this. It's my grandmother's engagement ring that my mom gave me she was kind of threatening to give it to me for a few years and I was like, she's still like what? Like oh my God, but then she gave it to me like two years ago when we moved home. I think it was very symbolic. Right? She was like finally moved here is this ring? So yeah, that's my most prized possession. I wear it every day with my wedding ring. And so it's a real like family or a time. I think I think my grandfather bought it in like the 20s 1920. So it's really bought it in Dublin on O'Connell Street from a Jewelers. Yeah. Yeah. So there's a whole like history where it's at. Hence the fear Terror but yeah, that's my most prized possession. Oh, that's a lovely one it is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Would you ever give it to Charlie to like use us an engagement ring? Don't know. Yeah, probably if she was working like in a few years if I really like the idea like I wouldn't be very young. What's the word with stuff? You know what you wouldn't be very sentimental very no. I'm generally I wouldn't be sentimental with things, right? Okay, but I do feel like it is quite unusual or unique to have a family earlier proper one. So and like I remember my grandmother wearing it and everything. So it's real, you know, there's a bit of feeling that yeah, so, I don't know I will be barriers your faith radio. You are in a new well, so my favorite perfume for the last I'd say four or five years is why a cell does it? I mean, I can't believe this I'm very loyal to my celibacy is black opium. Oh, yeah, that is very nervous. I know they've brought out different versions of it since then. I don't like them. I like the original. So I always buy it and duty-free. I was actually in the Middle East when it launched. I actually went to the launch priority in the Middle East and I remember smelling it and thinking oh my God, it's like coffee. He and Licorice and it's the most amazing fragrance. Yes, and we get like kind of like flour bomb but more expensive and a bit heavier. But in a it's very unique on thickly. We're like in a nice way. Yeah, it does there was certainly at the time it came out Nothing Like Us. Yeah, and I just like we got one of the event and everything how this is lovely and I used it often. I thought I'll just buy another one and then whatever happened now or years later, I'm still yeah buying it and Judy free and I love it. Yeah, it's my failsafe. Absolutely. Love it all. I do have I got a bottle of the new why settle on the other day. Oh bleep. Yes do a leaf. I think it's the face of it and that is very nice. So I'm kind of at the moment now, I'm between the two of those both why yourself just mad and I think about it and I was 13 that I also work whites are they? Yeah, they do have lovely Dooms agree. Yeah, and their men's cologne is very nice twice. Yeah, I bet they do it. Well, they do the fragrance. Well, yeah. Okay your biggest worry now. My biggest worry now is probably the real adult worried but it's probably just Health. Yeah, you know that we are well and that Charlie is well and he continues to be well and we stay healthy to be around 2, which is really a company of I'm saying that because I'm in my mid-thirties. I know I'm still young and everything but it really is a thing. Yeah, you know, we think about just staying healthy and trying to look after ourselves and and Charlie being healthy and but that's probably my biggest worry is one of us. Sick, yeah, or something happening like that, you know, like know the morning like Charlie going to school. It's like a military operation. Like here's your orange juice. Have you had your vitamin? Here's your Weetabix? Like, it's Leisure you like Warner for the other, you know, the face cloth of we have our you actually have a cream that we put on for my dry skin. And like I think we drive mad to be honest like he's the steps yes to go to every morning, you know, but I'm like, I'm just keeping you healthy, you know? Yeah, but yeah that that would be my biggest worry is somebody becoming ill or something happening. Yeah, I think that's a natural. I think we all owe total - just got a new job and I was like is their health insurance? I know I can't afford to really that's that's what we do trying somebody gets sick and you don't have health insurance. You know, I don't know it's not even I don't know it's but it is that's what it's expensive though. So it is hard to see but it is worth it. Yeah, it is like we finally have us I'm like, I'm going to book in for a full am I looking up everything I was like this is gonna be it now for your full well We're going to find something. I know like convinced in your mind. But I think we do do that to ourselves when were older like you're in your thirties. We all get it now, everybody has twinges and pains and Rhonda makes the come up out of nowhere and you think and you go on Google which is not a good idea and you're basically basically it like fucks up your kidneys and they were like and your P will be the color of tar. So every time we got stored on fully thinking I've damaged my kidneys from so fuck you just get so paranoid, you know you do and then also I think you know, we know we're less Invincible now. Yeah, we do see now all the time women that we know are women that that we know to other people or they get sick. They can cancer that die certain things happen or you know, there's always now, You know GoFundMe is or trying to help certain people and it's you know, we are getting older like we've lost that invincibility we had when we were young of like gonna live forever, you know that the GoFundMe Tsar amazing other credible, but they're also everyday aware of answering the corner there. I mean, they really are the best thing ever. I mean, I really think they are fantastic way. Yeah for families to get help and a lot of the time I think as well. It's a communication tool. It's a way of letting people know this is what's happening to us, too. You can't tell everybody you know or people, you know would help you. You don't people don't have time. Yeah, and so these amazing people step up for people and their family and set these up and say we need help and I think they're fantastic, you know a little donation that you make or I make like 20 year old 50 Euro and then if thousand of us do that like it's not even at a exactly what I mean. So I really I really think they are amazing. That was my resolution this year once a month. Yeah, whenever I get someone like a friend sends me one or Ever I will always be could only happen because I just think 2% It's such a small amount in the grand scheme of things. You know, why not? I would hope that somebody would do it for me like that with me. So and that's always how I think about it like Torchwood nothing like that will ever happen to us. But if it did I would hope because all the times that I did I think that other people think I'll just do it. Yeah, you know because it's very morbid order. Thanks for that will end here and that concludes in conclusion always Dopey. Article for Nummies Jesus. Okay moving on this thank God. This is an appropriate question. Where will you be in 10 years? Where will I be in ten years? Because it's real theme here. I would probably be overseas. I don't know where yeah, I'm telling you. There's sweet will turn to be in 10 years 17 B-17. Yeah, he'll probably be like, well, I'm not going with you. Love you, but by you know, like when I think about when I was 17, I wasn't here. I was I'd gone already overseas. So maybe he'll just do the same. I don't know. Are you might want to go with you? He might never know. I would love it. If I say to her now. I'm like you can live with me for the rest of your life. Like yeah. Mom loved you on like no. No, I mean it you want to get married your wife can live here with us like perhaps gonna be one of those mothers. Yeah now like in 10 years. Is I'll be in my mid forties and part of me saying that is because when we lived away, we were very young within the expat Community comparatively. Yeah, so a lot of the people that we knew and became friends with were in their mid Force. Yes, a lot of them had gone at that point. And so I think if we're going to do it again, that's probably when we would go and maybe we would be away already or or maybe we won't I mean if you ask me now, I'm going to say we probably would Overseas. Yeah, but plan we will have heard maybe will be 12 years in Dublin at that point and I'll be living my best life and thinking what was I thinking about living overseas? This is the body, you know, so I don't know. Yeah would probably be overseas but and it'll be interesting to see in 10 years. Where would be the place that everyone's going? Yeah, like I certainly at 17 I certainly would never have envisaged the life that I've had. Yeah in the time between 17 and now yeah, like I know I would have Traveled and done a bit more but I would never if somebody told me like this is the kind of life. You have lived by the time you're 35, I would have been like no way. Yeah, you know, there's no way yeah, there's no way but of course that's trained by her stuff out of my mouth. So yeah, so it's probably something similar. I'm glad I believe another 10 years of shenanigans overseas. I don't even know I don't know. But yeah, maybe they're open to a moment. Yeah. I think it's in our veins, you know, it's just to do stuff and travel and but then equally I'm quite happy where I am as well so like I can kind of make I don't know I can kind of make it work wherever. Yeah, like if somebody said to me, okay. So on you're going to stay in Dublin for the rest your life or you going to stay in our own you can lift and go away fine. That's fine. Like a mind. That's that's Grand. We'll do that or if somebody said you're going to move to Australia tomorrow and you can live there for five years. Okay, fine. We'll make it work. Yeah. Yeah just do like I've never been one to cling on to a door frame and be dragged anywhere like, you know, just go with the flow and whatever happens will happen and wherever we go. We'll go God Colors of the Wind. Pocahontas to the theme music here. Yeah. So yeah, so that's the answer to that question. Brilliant. Well, thank you so much for coming my God. Thanks for having me. It's brilliant. Hi. I'm like, oh my God, especially the rose a that you provided was wonderful. It's not bad for a while and every time I'm like, it's very pale. That's usually my way of racial. Yeah, so there's one called notorious same thing. Is that Conor McGregor? Imagine if he were notorious. Well, I'll get it for the next time. I'll go a little Conor McGregor sticker and put it on the back just so we be so funny. Yeah, we had to light it with that now. Yeah, honestly Boston must just be like what is wrong with him every time they see myself. I think that's a great way to buy euros a though. Even if you have if you've only got like three or four minutes and you're running into a supermarket just scan by the color the palest of the nadir it is usually it means the lighter the dryer it is the darker. It's more sweet therapy. And yes European. Yeah. So I usually even if I don't have time to read them, but I know I need to grab a bite. I love I would just scan for like the palest one and then get oh, yeah. Yeah, I am walked in the other day and they were doing a rose a testing. Oh, well, I had two little chiffon the dream and I hear lee fucking stumbled. It really looks pretty strong. It just landed. So I was like, I haven't eaten in other words the volume was it must have been high it was I don't know but it was that notorious one so long, that's why it's called. It's very strong. Yeah. Fuck dude cinnamon my God. But yeah, thank you for coming in. Thank you for having me. It's been absolutely wonderful order. Let's cheers and laughter cheers tinkling clink.\",\n",
       " \"In this podcast I discuss the connection between narcissistic abuse and mental illness.  Hello everyone. Welcome to narcissism recovery podcast. I'm your host its Epstein. I am a narcissistic abuse life coach and today. I'll be talking about narcissism and mental illness first. I'm gonna Define mental illness according to the American Psychiatric Association Mental illness or mental illnesses are health conditions involving changes in Emotion, thinking or behavior or a combination of these mental illnesses are associated with distress and or problems functioning in social work or family activities. I have a slightly different definition that I like to use. It is similar, but I'm going to Define mental illness as the ability or I should say the inability to correctly assess a situation because of Channel dysregulation leading to behavioral breakdowns and mental disabilities. So the reason why I want to make that sort of slight adjustment to the definition is because I want to bring attention to the fact that the individual is has distorted ability to assess the situation and see it for what it is. They're oftentimes seeing it from an emotionally reactive state which leads to decisions that are dysfunctional not healthy and not aligned. With the individuals best interests or I should say best long-term interests. Now, the mind is extremely complex. So there's never usually one answer for all mental illness. There are so many different things that come into play when it comes to mental illnesses often times people say it's genetics. Some people say that mental illnesses are from abuse. I'm say that mental illnesses are coping skills that have that are not that are maladaptive now. To bring in some inside here from Maslow's hierarchy of needs according to Maslow. There are five sort of pyramid. Look on the top of the pyramid. There are five different hierarchical needs that are that work in a hierarchical way on the bottom. There's physiological so your food and your your sustenance. Then there's safety. Love belonging is next esteem is next and the top of the most Important need we have as human beings is self-actualization. Now without any of these individual stages or should say needs being met. There's going to be a lack. There's going to be a certain need to fill and ultimately what happens is that the individual who's missing that lack and cannot get the need met through healthy means will oftentimes revert to dysfunctional means addictive means manipulative means in order to fulfill those needs. An addiction for example is a desire to get love and belonging most often and it's a need that is met by manufacturing and experience that feels loving and belonging and in self accepting. So the attic for example, we'll be looking for that love that acceptance that comes with the safety and love of the drug or the addiction. Without these needs met the individual becomes sick now, they might become sick physically oftentimes mentally and it can be argue that anyone who is essentially mentally ill could be really just be in the lack of their needs being met and trying to really cope and deal with the lack of those emotional psychological and mental needs being met such as self-actualization belonging. Self-esteem I want to connect this to narcissistic abuse narcissistic abuse victims, but really narcissistic abusers themselves are underdeveloped. And therefore they resort to exploiting others to get their needs met the most common need I would say with narcissistic abusers is the need for belonging and love Now because of their feelings of Shame and humiliation and feeling less than from host usually their own abuse renting them rendering them feeling unacceptable. They therefore look to others to manipulate to exploit to make themselves feel better to fulfill that unmet need. Narcissistic narcissistic abusers are looking to their victims for a supply a narcissistic Supply to make up for that deficit. So whatever the esteem physiological psychological emotional need that's that's that his unmet the perpetrator will look for victims who can fulfill that need and then take it essentially steal it exploit them for it. This can happen for any need. They may be looking for safety and cling to a wealthy partner to exploit them for their front four Financial safety victims of abuse might become codependent. And while this isn't necessarily narcissistic there is similarities in that they're looking for a relationship for that love and safety and connection and maybe lack of a Russian see to resolve the abandonment feeling through the relationships in that way. They're looking to get their needs met through the relationship even though the relationship is Not necessarily not ultimately fulfilling them in other ways. But at least they're able to Sue this one need. I want to offer some tips on how to deal with having unmet childhood needs because if you go into adulthood and into an adult relationships trying to get your childhood needs met it will there is a high chance that you will key in on somebody who's able to offer you that need but ultimately might be emotionally unavailable or potentially abusive and that's why it is important to meet your needs your childhood needs in adulthood. Through doing the inner child healing work in order to make sure that you don't look for abusers who will do what is called the repetition compulsion. The repetition compulsion is a compulsion to repeat your traumas in adulthood essentially to finally get to resolve that need and ultimately move on past that developmental stage when this doesn't happen. We essentially are looking for adult relationships which often times become a repetition they become abusive and that's why it is important to heal your childhood wounds. Before you enter into a relationship and this is done by self-reflecting identifying wounds identifying triggers identifying behavioral patterns that have worked mostly coping mechanisms, identifying addictions identifying core beliefs that stemmed from having your needs not met. For example, I can't get my needs met is a belief and therefore what we end up doing is we end up creating scenarios where we can't get our needs met such as manipulative emotionally unavailable and potentially narcissistic abusers who may even Promise and exploit and pry and kind of key in on the unmet needs of the victim really an exploit them and that's essentially what narcissistic abuse or do they see an unmet need key in on it promise to fulfill it and ultimately never do stringing victims along in the hopes that they can get that childhood need met. It's extremely important. Like I said to heal your childhood wounds healing your childhood wounds is not just for relationships. Even if you never want to be in a relationship again healing your childhood wounds is Necessary because if you don't heal your childhood wounds, like I said, you are a victim. You are a hostage of your past. You cannot move on into adulthood. You cannot be fulfilled. You cannot self-actualize you cannot be fulfilled and truly happy. So even if you decide not to be in a relationship, even if you decide you're going to defend yourself from relationships because of the pain that you have been through which is totally an entirely understandable. However, in order to really truly be content and satisfied and at peace within and have mental health Otherwise, we will there is meant you know developmental stages the lack of that developmental stages fulfillment of Developmental stages creates this he's mental this he's so in order to create any form of peace and health happiness and fulfillment within healing your childhood wounds, which will ultimately lead to Health on all levels. The Minot therapy system, which I work with is designed to help you identify your childhood wounds resolve the conflicts of childhood that were not resolved in childhood and ultimately heal those wounds so that you can move on into adulthood and manifest your best life without doing so unfortunately these pull us back. They pull us back they drag us down because you cannot move on into adulthood without closing the file with your abusers with your past and that is why healing grieving resolving. Conflicts and closing the file emotional file is Paramount for health for mental health and ultimately to avoid any exploitive relationships that promise to get your needs met. If you're struggling with this issue. If you have childhood wounds and you find yourself in great mental distress understand that it is an indicator. It is a symptom showing you that there are wounds you need to take a look at that and identify what those wounds are and heal them. I'd be happy to work with you.

I'm fully involved with management now. Yeah involved with your strategy on on how you are as an artist and how you're about to grow and develop luckily enough. You know, how it ended up in Sony. Prior to even joining Columbia was just one of the artists. I was helping freelance got signed. However, yeah, you don't go through cause I want to Pace, right? Yeah, you realize there's no like I was going to say pace cars over here. Love it down downtown. Yeah. There's only one is that we acknowledge. There is only one case campus. Sorry. Sorry Pleasantville. Yeah doesn't that doesn't get registered. Yeah, but there's no music class like there's no like music. - course or music marketing course, but you're deeply immersed in everything. Like I was I was same deal like I'd worked I'd always been around music like I'd always done and like so I didn't have studied business. Yeah, great for business but didn't have music business or but you're in the you're in the heart of New York. Absolutely. So I'm like, I'm at the source.com and turning like I have all these like I pop up like my had friends that were working at label. So I pull up to their internships. I'm like doing like you Are doing a little odd jobs, you're going to open mics and doing all that stuff. So like you're getting a practical internship just by being knee-deep in the scene of like in the kind of the burgeoning seen that you want to make a lifestyle out of her makeup make a way of life out of course. So yeah, that's just how we end up exactly dad like you go to these spaces you need people because you are a music lover at the end of the day. So you're sure for the new thing you're looking for who's hot your yes. It was to discover Talent. Absolutely and you Are you know meeting more and more people you start meeting more and more artists. And yeah, one of them looking enough got signed to a label under Sony music. I was helping with creative Direction on the website and the - yeah, and I'm like, what do you mean? This is a job? Yeah, right. Oh I can get paid for this I get paid it. Yeah. Yeah, hold up you telling me that I can get like Health Insurance Dental to be here. Consistent check is yeah. Let's check what you chasing right 60 right right arm with this bills and buy a metro card. This is that like him like Dart is getting signed to me like you. Let me just go with you do it like a meeting. Right? Right, then from there. I was just like hey, I'm in college. Yep. I'm about to graduate like what's up? Can I get like a freelance job and internship? What? How do you guys do this? Yeah. What's the next step? What's the next step Yeah Yeah from their II intern for like half a semester. Graduated was just freelancing for the artist. Yes, typically because they went to bathroom. You looked out like not that's our creative guy from day one. He's been helping so what can we do? So then I was getting like a freelance check waiting for an opportunity to open underselling music as far as like a head count, right? That's the first time I've learned that that's like we can't just hire you, you know numbers got to be there. Every Super intern. Yes, really good in a label like you can be the best thing as a in turn free worker, but if that head count is an open for stay the course. Like getting it. Yeah, I had to learn that. Yeah, and it's something that I share with active and here I mean, I'm sure this will ya Murph when he was my intern I was like look it's it's unfortunate. But you learned like I saw people get gigs before me. Yeah, and he's just because they were in a department that was like where they said that an opening held by choice not always like its first person up is not always the best person up. She has that it's something that you have to really kind of Steel yourself for and just stay the court like it's difficult because you at things like a negative balance in a bank account like a rumbling stomach. Yeah, you know taking three buses because you know, the Long Island Railroad isn't necessarily an option, you know, like you look at all these things and you're just like, all right, I could really use like a consistent salary and some healthcare. Yeah sharp a lot of to Growers license out of two Bros. Oh man. Yes a lot of dollars and but like you look at that and you're just like, you know what I it gets rough, but and then that's the test to that's Real pressure test like do you want this I do you really want to and if you can just like you were saying a minute ago, John walczyk State Building, but it's about staying the course like you were saying in like yo, it's gonna it's gonna test you just like anything else in life. It's gonna test you at times and if you really want it, you know, just keep working at it. And and and I mean, that's it. Right. I mean that thing is like you hustle because you realize it's like a weight if this labels willing to pay a freelancer to do this, there's a hunter who's got a bit. Yes, but not everybody realizes that see See, that's the thing. If you're freelancing it one label, you're afraid is like, all right, let me stay here. So you kind of have to find that balance and when you understand how headcount Works, you're like, all right, I can step back and just let them like keep doing what I'm doing keep killing it and let them come to me with an offer but a lot of the initial inclination like and that's something I had to learn because I was so loyal. I was at Def Jam and I was like sitting in the back of the Boiler Room freelancing coming in five days a week first first one in last one out for my like freelance shackles. Freelance Jack until I you know till taxes like but like you do all of this and like you don't like you're staying look and you don't realize you can take on outside work. Absolutely you can answer an email you can do some other like you can diversify. Yeah and pick up these checks from elsewhere. And then you're also putting yourself on the relay on the radar and that's that's the one. Yeah, you start putting your name out there you start putting your work out there you start creating more and more relationships because then it's building starts buzzing because if you're really good, they'll run into each other the industries so small. What they'll do like, wait, what do you mean? Oh, no, I got a guy. Oh, yeah, that's like that guy. Yea though, I use them to and then that changes HR all of a sudden becomes a step that superstar in turn. The industry is poorly built high school. It's all poorly built high school Everybody Talks. It's like fomo is like the number-one thing is everyone just hates missing. Yeah, man, it's both like Talent on the music Side by Talent on the business side as well. Sure. Like they go for it for sure do the best by you. Just want to make sure nobody else can't even see ya. So get it. Into a little bit more some of the specifics you got a quick story. Unlike your most favorite moment working in the industry. Thus far like was it working on a really big project? I mean you've worked on some of the biggest in recent years or was it like something small just starting out that like really, you know kept that momentum going. I mean, so two stories one at confine is like humorous. So I feel like this is like super important. I was in international marketing for like a year. And a half so we were in charge of you know, telling the story making sure that we were properly representing the project xus outside of the United States. One of the things that I went through was really funny was bringing a project from like the country to a different country because of leaks you can't just like email it. Yeah. Yeah. It's ironic in a working 2090. You gotta fly over there like iPods no shit like old-school iPod to go to a different like label. Wow for Sony music. Yeah it did. Yo, here you go. Right. Wow, hilarious story. I was there with like an artist manager. We were delivering this project and the game plan and the whole marketing company, we're doing display back to invite every single press in that country got stopped by TSA. Oh shit and they were like, hey, like what are you here for? Like we need to open like this bag. I'm like I cool. You can open the bag. Hey, what's this and it's this iPod is my first time like being in this role before. So yeah this like, - Hallie to like I can tell you that you don't press that button. Whatever you do don't like. Hey, just let it go. Yeah, so they were likewise like well like it's I can't I can't play you two. Like I can't tell you what's in it, right? It's just private confidential do thought I was like just a complete asshole because of that. Yeah, so I held me for like two hours. Oh shit, like wow the artist managers waiting outside. Oh my God, like the story here is like this artist this Bull management relationship and how big does become I was freaking out. I was like, oh man. Sorry smashes been waiting there for so long. I know whatever I get out and I'm like other they're hot. They've waited here for like good 2 hours and 20 minutes at this point as the TSA member goes. Hey, why did you why did you held him back? He goes getting want to tell us what's in this iPod and the Martin the manager was like, let's go out. Oh shit. He had that night and spoke to me about how like you were willing to go. They're that far. Yeah, an artist is confidentiality and they took that to heart because it was like the explain to me like if this did leak, yeah it is game over is this is where it gets to be right for your but it's like think of it from the artist side. It's something that they've been working on for year right thing. You're holding. It is your own like you're keeping it close and they were like that's amazing like you like that. I've never liked that you were willing to go to like extreme limits force and I was and I'm sitting there and I've I was like, oh, yeah, you were just doing it out like like like Goodfellas. It's like it's a you tell nobody got anything. Yeah six-month campaign and it was easy for us to get through the line from the label side. It was here first because they trusted me would any decision. I was hoping you've already faced off against the government like maybe that fell in love because I was like, I never experienced that before in terms of like changing a full relationship First first day we met wow. I told him you had some um, That had a nonprofit organization. It was fighting for a change that was happening. So, you know within the United States but mostly globally that like that meant a lot because that was more than about music but we're connected to the music at the essence of the songwriting. But it we were hiring people that don't usually get that type of Love. Yeah that are really like have gone through unfortunate events and situations and found inspiration out of it and was like, I'm going to I'm going to get up and make a change just the impact. It sounds like the impact of the music was just like I was that was The incredible that's what music is all about the right person. What can you really do for people and how can I really uplift people in some way shape or form? Yeah. I was highlighting and tying that music back together with people that you know have been doing this for years and giving and giving them some sort of highlight is a beautiful thing for sure. So yeah man want to get into some of the specifics right now to help those those people that are coming up and kind of get super technical a little bit but one of the big things that a lot of people Of trouble doing is defining Their audience write an artist or a manager that like, oh shit, who is this music really for that? We're working on so, you know, what's the best way to go about doing that? Is there an exercise that you like to use? When when you start working on a new project that you know helps you define what the fan base is going to be in the audience that you're going after is there anything in particular, you know, just kind of over time you start to just get a better understanding of where? Music's going and where something might fit. I think it's both I think for front up-and-coming artists your base is so small whoever gravitates to it is your audience and it's on you to learn that like you should definitely learn them not to sound weird. But like go through there you don't you have a lot for understand all of them go through their Instagrams see what they're into have an understanding who are the people to gravitate know who you're speaking to so, you know how to speak to them right now and I think your best way to do is literally go through comments on Instagram. Yeah your comments on YouTube, you know if you're selling stuff on iTunes you will see feedback on iTunes to just like go on Twitter and like research yourself and what p and who these people are speaking about you and then go into each of them. You'll start realizing there's a Common Thread. Yeah between like the people you're clicking on on Twitter and the people you understand like we hold up. They also like these artists. They also like these brains you start seeing those things, right but then for artists are established you kind of realize you open this up. You're like, are you Do have a base now right have a foundation. We have to get you bigger or we want to be bigger. So we're helping you get bigger and then becomes understanding the artist. What else are you into because each pocket of a lifestyle is there's a niche online that's living there. And all you need to do is just tap into them a message to them. Right? So it's like understanding the artist is the second thing. It's like what are you into as an artist outside of musically into video games and sneakers into fashion, whatever food, whatever may be and you Are identifying those people and then you start hitting them and kind of like the two ways. I look at it in terms of just to piggyback off that for a second for the people that are just starting out. How did they even get that like is the best way I mean, we've talked to a number of people where it's like when you first start now it's about quantity over quality. You've got to start just putting out a ton of music to like get that feedback to see what people are saying and to like not necessarily hold back on everything, you know, is that something that you think people starting out should do is like, you know, just Just let it rip go just go because it becomes a part of your artist development story right as a part of your process story. If you're documenting that online on socials, which is like the legitimate point of why the internet even exist you're giving people this behind-the-scenes look of how you are getting better and better and when you bring someone that in-depth into the creation process they fall in love with you more in my opinion. I think that they feel like Derek dare with you. They want to see you grow. They build a vested interest you letting them track with your trajectory. And feed them you got to feel whoever's listening feed your fans and your fans. I think people try to cheat that not realizing that you can't like they just want to get to the point of deepest impact as quickly as possible. And I think that leads people to a lot of things like buying an engagement. So buying likes buying followers buying views buying streams. I guess I always talk about like the detriment to that anytime somebody talk brings out in the conversation. They're always talking about the downside but it's something that's widely practiced like So do you see any pluses Sandy part of that? And do you see any - has to that? There is no pluses to buying anything. That's not real. The I can't even like although say that because when I was in high school, no, sorry when I was in college, I was a sophomore I bought a fake Louis bag and it was a major plus because I pulled up with its campus and I look like that dude. Yeah, then you pulled up outside of campus. But know what a real Louis bag looks and then I never made it that far. I was running down the subway steps the strap broke, so That was the end of it. Yes, and I carried myself in my arms. This is the sad story. I could write for Disney. These are yo harrowing Tales depends that depends on editing and the way yeah someone in Rotten Tomatoes with like a breakdown paragraph about how would it allergies? Yeah, print hit the pavement. So we go positive. What are the drawbacks the drawbacks is? Is like right we and mm become super transparent the way you make money as an artist in or at least a majority of your pie of your profit and your revenue or Revenue at the end of the year comes from touring and merge no matter how we shake it. That's just what it is Faith followers does not equate to real hard tickets being sold. So that's just where it is. Yeah, right. So that's one from like when you actually made it standpoint, but the other part is like you I just mentioned it. You have to learn your fans you have to be able to click on The comment on Instagram go through their Instagram and be like, oh, yeah, they all sweet there into the shit that I'm in right at that time, acquiring the people that want to acquire a fake followers going to get you nothing. You have ever gone down select photos. Yep, big biolink doesn't it's not even if there's if there's no value. There's no real value yet. But I think what they're going into is thinking that if they are going to somebody or they're trying to appeal to somebody like a complex or they're trying to catch the attention of a brand or a label or anything like this. Yeah, they want to Have at least the optic of you know, I have 750,000 people following me. That's arrogant as hell. It is super arrogant because that's you assuming that these like 4500 fashion brands and these top media companies like a complex and fader don't have social media management teams in the building features a baseline word. That's not even like don't go there if you're up and coming artists put it out. Don't even look at the number go to the next day. Like Let It Be just concerned with you. Be concerned with just getting it out and got like 100 percent and in your music out is like important. I think that's it. And for sure, I mean there's we continue to ask people that same question because we want to reiterate that point like over and over and over again so that you know, if you don't understand that from the first person that we talk to you get it from the second or the third or the fourth person because it's like it's really about trying to build value no matter what in the fake shit that plays the streams of whatever. You know these companies to fill in your middle of the road stream. Yeah, it's just it's not going to work. There are other growth hacks out there that provide real value and it's about you really doing the work exactly. It's about really putting out a bunch of music. You may find that like, oh you drop a song every Friday for a month like you're seeing a lot more real traction from that. That's the growth act. So then the hack becomes our every single Friday for the next year. I'm going to continue to drop music message that you write in the build-up to eat it you could on Discovery, right? Right you doing? Yeah, and that's where changes. Yeah, there is really no shortcuts to this like at all. So then that's like a perfect segue into the next part here. Like it can be overwhelming for people just starting out with all the platforms. Like there's something new popping up every other month, you know, it's kind of leveled out where there's like, you know, three or four really big ones, you know, but do you think that artists starting out should just narrow in on one or two? Two platforms that they love or that they're really good at as opposed to like being on four or five and being like average across everything. I mean, I think it depends on one like what you're capable of as an artist. So if you have a team like you should be able to put content up in every single. I'm assuming it's all about social platforms are we talked about DSP? Social platforms? Social platforms? Yeah. Yeah, you should be able to at least mirror everything you're putting up in one, you know in one platform that you're focusing. And across all right presence there, right? Even if it's just to own the name just to even start their right to have it on the name, right? And then it becomes you can literally connect your Instagram in your Facebook. I'll push lets you know, there's is 2019. Yes waste of you everywhere. Now as far as where you spend your time on an engagement level like when you start talking to fans when you start use you figure out your flow, right? What are you really good at? Like if are you a very visual artist? So he's understanding you right you as ours you have to understand yourself first. Your team has to understand how you move first and foremost, but if your visual artists and you live and die by photography and system and good visuals and good videos, then you ewbank on Instagram right Bank on a much more visual platform. But if you're an artist where you're really good at one-liners and you know how to like snap back at fans unlike a positive, right? Yeah, we're Snapback. I was happening culturally then you yeah you Saying on Twitter. I think you understand yourself. But yeah, you could put your focus in one but it doesn't mean you completely just desert the others. I think you have to get smart with just you know, reusing your content right begin, right? It's on which one you feed most consistently and how ya like you can check in on Instagram if you are good with the Snapbacks and what them like the one-liners you just turning into a caption. Yeah pick and just let that be it like you don't necessarily to be on stories doing that Jim you'd like on Twitter firing off and yep. Yeah agreed and I think that's like the biggest Point there's like knowing yourself, you know, because people just starting out there. There's always that case of fomo, you know what I mean? Like you're missing and it's like just bring it back to yourself. What do you love doing and and then work from there? Yeah, you know and be like, all right, cool. My main focus is going to be Twitter and then I can just reproduce this the shit and then if you have a manager or you have someone else that's working with you a graphic designer on your team, then like that's some stuff that you can offload to them exactly. That's like the alley-oop a man take this thing off Twitter, you know copy and paste exactly what weird other way around whatever's on Instagram copy and paste and put it on Twitter. But that role until we can get, you know, smarter weed how we use each platform, right? But these be present have a presence in each one and time will tell as far as like you having more hands to hell right now having you know more people around you that can potentially completely take that load off for that whole platform off your hands so they can just run it themselves. I think that will happen as you Philip as an artist the next layer of that then becomes, you know metrics to look at so like what are some key metrics that you look at with some of the big brain or the big acts that you work with is it like alright obviously engagement is huge. But is it more so common it's over Lex. Is there any one thing in particular that shows like? Okay you can you see it in this really small space and because it's happening here, you know, it's going to just like Skyrocket and I look at comments a lot. I even more specific. I look at people's comments. For the tag their friends, like let them know that this is happening because you can you can buy fake likes comments. You learn so much. That's a good point comment. And that's a that's a actual effort from a person if you can get someone a comment they will like yourself because you're like it. Yeah, I appreciate our Instagram is kind of adding that layering now where they're making comments, especially transparent because now you can like a comment as well. Yeah. So if somebody's tagging people are like that comment at like you can reply and you can like you're adding another depth to it of Amen to that, so you really are making comments or true or metric you're not just putting it out there and just saying, okay. This picture has 200 likes but it has a hundred ninety-seven comment. So clearly there's like some action happening on the doctors. Like you have a comment that has 50 likes on it and it has 25 responses of its own and you know, it does make it a bit makes it a bit more of an intuitive metric and and I have like a theory this didn't come from like Instagram or anything like but actually like just from studying each platform. Especially Instagram. I've come to realize that Since things don't isn't on an order anymore by time and is in order by like the comments like will float you up. So the more Christ you tend to be the first two or three on another person's timeline, right? Yes. Sure. It's fun. Because like hey, this is Pop. Yeah. I'm waiting for like an official like statement from missing them all. That's you're actually correct. This is just me. I just a theory of mind. Yes works. Right? Right, right more comments. You have you will float above everyone else on it. So then then how does how does an artist take that metric and then apply it to something actionable going forward is is like it's really about mining that being like, okay cool over the last three posts. I got x amount of comments and then it's about trying to reproduce that that same sort of content and but in a new way right and talk to your fans, right if you engage put it on your stories say new post go like and comment like you kind of have you kind of have to constantly double back. Yep and Hammer in that they need to be engaged. Each other with this in some way like you can do a call to action. I think that's something that people have gotten too proud for where those of us who have worked in and around media particularly digital media when it was New Media. Hey, right like you call to action. That was all we had. Yeah, go listen those stream click here, right? That was what you had was that call to action. I think now everything is so in line whether it's a tweet and you just put a link in there you like Like all right. Now you two were now everyone is to absolutely ask their fans to do right? No cute might delete later goes back to engagement. You can't be too cool to want to connect with the people you want to connect with you and with right and and to spend. Money, right you want them to spend their money at some point you're going to ask them to come to a show or buy a piece of merch if you're not going the extra mile to talk to them. If I'm see you in the class. I'm gonna send you a bottle. I want to have a shot with right exactly. I want you to actually a cage with you. I don't want to look at you on high right my tribute to you about my tithes and offerings. Yeah, no meet me at the bar. Yeah. Let's have a glass of the shittiest vodka they connected so that as you build and as I build we can come back dirty because little bottle. Yeah, they're honking. That's exactly that's because it's backwards now like social existed for people to have one-on-one connection, right absolutely was designed for this. Yeah. Yeah artists don't do this yard is don't speak to their fans artists like not even the fuck the by now like asking what do you think of these drums right really into that conversation for you by tell me how you feel about it? What do you like about? - change introduce them to a premix. Yeah, I put this link up. Give it a listen. I'm going to keep it up for the week. Let me know what you think of your back in the studio end of the week. I'm chain. That's an excellent point. You're such a jerk people into the creative and I've what I've managed like I've we put out premixes or we do you put aversive when IG stories or you do like these little things and you say you know what, let's get their input. Yeah, like let the fans executive see if it hits ya because they are investors and you know, they just familiarity. That's not other say yeah, just like you heard them seven, who are those women? Bars War they can fall in love with her - so then you hear the final you're like it immediately as human-like nature. You're like wait, I heard that before. Yeah exactly. We've got away from because I mean this is there's a separate old-ass debate that we're going to have we're going to bring this back for a conversation. We just complain about the state of rap but quick it's hum, like I think rappers like when they went to radio when they did mixtapes. Oh, yeah. He really is a freestyle. Yeah that verse ends up being your favorite verse from a song on the record, but you know it inside and out because you've seen That show job because you've heard it on a freezer because like uh Spanish and it's literally 100% And they know it's that verse that's why they go out and say it and every fucking that's why they say it on the DVD another Noble wife DVD exactly and you can ad-lib the shit out of it. So when you put a beat behind it and put a curse on it, it's not your favorite shit. Yeah, and you can't escape it being your favorite shit and people get away from ship. They're so concerned with shit being new. Yeah. It was shit being shiny that they forget about shit being loved. Yeah, and it's just it's what we fully got away from again engagement. We they don't care about engagement anymore. They want to play like they absolutely to back in my day. But I think there's two people that have done that really well somebody like gambino from like jump. If you go back you can see shit. You can see videos of him at NYU doing freestyles. Like I think the one cool thing about him is that one of the cool things about him is that you can see that progression of like He was just like really trying to wrap and try and figure this shit out and like, you know, what was super quirky and then you can see all the themes that he was talking about in like how he got better and he was doing it in front of us, right? And then I was like, okay rapping then I'm going to act then it's I'm gonna do stand up then it's I'm going to write then it's you know, and to see that progression is what people fall in love with right and now you're like, oh my God, that's amazing. That's transparency. It not start, right? No. No that's parents you dies what allows him to absolutely yeah because He never opened that up that curtain up. Yeah didn't know he was capable of all these other things. He came out the jump as a rapper right right breast and up. I don't know if we would have fully exploit like accepted that I'm not a hundred percent. Sure. Yeah, that's everyone who's stumbled upon the explore page. Do you know why the food Instagram pages and all those videos and shit do so. Well, it's because we love the process. Yeah more than we love the final product. And that's just human nature. So if you give people a glimpse into that process show them how it's coming. It can be the most tedious should ever but if you show them that process they will absolutely he could be the most likely they were I need food shit. They were not even started. Sorry to cut you off but it's going right where I was going. It's like they'll forgive you as well you're looking at Kanye is perfect. But I saw it come together Kanye is is the prime example that right now obviously all the crazy political stuff that he's been saying over there. Last right says slavery was a choice. I was like seriously, no. No, but but it's been like that crazy where it's like people that have always loved him and fought for him because of what he represented. He just completely went back on that's a whole other conversation. But just to put a button on on this part about being transparent showing people behind the curtain a little bit the Sunday service stuff, you know what I mean? It's like for better for worse, whatever you think about it, like there's a bunch of people a few weeks ago when he had that. One record that dropped and he's out there like stomping on the ground there were like, oh shit or forgiving because the rock right see here like long as well. Okay into yeah Collective Grace's Sprite. You're absolutely and and then I mean, yes, I can't no no, I mean it's hard. It's for real, but it's like but it's also like it hurts to say that those who because you're like, you don't want to say that but it's like man, but for the people here in this room, there are forcing her brothers who were talking who were talking around like you know what he's trying hears him yelling up like yeah, like for those of us who see it as pandering are those who and you know, hopefully they're listening but there are those who see it as him like bringing his way back into forgetting because our processing his weight. Right? Right is that word again to processing his way back into forgiveness into being? Okay, right? It's being okay with him and hopefully that's the Kate. Hopefully, hopefully hopefully exactly exactly but um, I remember before we get you out of here though with everybody would kind of At the end we kind of want to make it super simple for the listeners. Like what are your top five tips for, you know up-and-coming artist when it comes to building their fan base with the marketing that they're doing is they're like, it doesn't have to be five. Maybe it's just like tricks and doesn't have any financially the bike just some things to look for like if there was a short list on the undeniable. Yeah, so maybe that's better instead of typing. What are your undeniable sense in terms of what you need to be looking for and what you need to be doing to build your audience is one I think understand yourself. And yourself as an artist understanding what you stand for understanding where your music stands for understanding who you're trying to acquire as a fan base who you're speaking to as far as like your writing as a songwriter. That's one. I think that's like has to always be the started because that's the foundation Foundation, right? Then second is like consistency just like consistency and not being and being confident the work you're creating but be consistent like just continue to put stuff out because that'll help with the confidence to yes. It's but stuff get those reps and put this put your reps in put your stuff. I get your shots out there like this stuff out on every platform that you can if it's just sound physics. Just put your music out there post on socials, you know, put yourself out there as much as possible. That's to write talk to your fans has three or and engage with them and speak to them and for just like get don't hold back man. A lot of artists really are like waiting for the perfect moment to put stuff out and the next thing, you know, two years flew by yeah. Or what you were working on that was of the moment. That was great. Yeah is no longer its dated. Yeah, you you took you to all of it actually. Yeah, you might have been ahead of it. We have decided to wait to get like the perfect situation instead of just letting it out in your waited for the perfect. Yes Ted of creating the perfect. Yeah absolutely get creative get creative. That's both from a visual standpoint and the music standpoint and then like on a budget Stretch $100. We write the best out of 20 bucks. Yeah, really, like get creative with everything that touch such a gem because like people think you can't do anything. Oh, I only got a hundred or two hundred dollars. It's like, you know instead of buying those Jordans, you could invest it back into you know, a photo shoot or you know paying somebody to do your artwork for your Instagram page or whatever. Like that's an investment. That's how you should be thinking about the little bit of money that you have when you're first starting out and don't think that you need a lot. Not to like make ya best product like yeah, I mean five six music videos off the top of my head right now. That was less than 2 300. Yeah. It's about being creative. Yeah, it's just and it's you make it you make it work. Yeah, and and and I think the coupled with that it's about paying attention to what's going on on the networks that you're on so Instagrams your thing pay attention Instagram. Look at the accounts that are Poppin read your comments everything that you were saying and then take that and be okay. Those are your creative like pillars that you could Just a framework for how you should be thinking about it. It's like okay. This is the guy that could use how can I what can I do with a hundred dollars? That would get me X Y and Z, you know, whatever those things are. So yeah, I think those are those are super clutch. So yeah, man, I appreciate you appreciate you coming through before you get out of here. You know, what are you working on that? You're super excited about now, and you know, let the people know where they can find, you know that good stuff. I mean there's a lot happening right now.

Yo yo Billy Ray Billy Ray. Absolutely. It's been a it's been a song of the century. I remember you telling me about that a couple of weeks ago. And at first I was like, you know what and then captures I think was going on in 2019 and was happening in Iran was happening in youth culture. Yeah - a perfect definition of that and then it's a few up-and-coming are like Dominic Ficus someone that like were you know where heavily investing in and as far as like work and love goes and we just want to see the next step of that because we think he's really, you know, he's Amish Opus fucked Elm. And Dominic's is what's up, and I'm little TJ Polo G on The Hip Hop side of Columbia Records. So there's a lot man.

Is going to be a gem coming out 2019 at this is gonna be a good one. Nice man. I'm where to find me John Vincent south side of the name Chuck underscore don't like the weird. Social medias.

       " \"How the food we consume matters and effects our energy, learn more of how you can see through today’s sh*t & shop for your health!  Hello. I wish I could sing because my name is Adela, but I can't so let's just say welcome to my podcast again and it's my first episode will who where were talking about finding your mind body and energy? Of course today? I am going to give you a little look into I'll look through I should say My Lens, you know, like the way I see things. So let's just jump right into it before it Mumble on.Way too much. So I look at everything as if it's feeding me and feeding yourself to me means. Okay. What am I giving my body today? What am I feeding myself? What am I reading? What am I saying on my walls? What is my environment looking like? What am I wearing? Who am I hanging around? It's everything it's how we build ourselves what we choose to allow to influence us. And so that's literally I'm talking about today what I choose and how I choose to shop what I feed myself and I'm going to start this with a poem that I actually wrote and it's a soup that is she little are super short one. So are you a robot? We you designed in a factory? No, so why do we consume from factory-made canned foods and fast food businesses then wonder why we struggled to get up in the morning with low or no energy and life force. These Foods were not human made. They were money made conveniently feeding your weakness of being too lazy. They punishment not nourishment designed for illness not Wellness. You want to feel good. You have a body not a machine feed it like it's alive and worth being. It real whole food. So you thrive not just survive. Let that sink in for a minute because boom that when I wrote that even I hurt my own feelings, I was like, oh my God, like because as humans do that, we literally like a so lazy like humans people. We're just so lazy and I'm kind of talking like myself, but I'm saying where because I don't like to say, I'm not this and that like, you know well together with in this shit together overall. We like trade our money for convenience. How crazy is that and half the problem is it's not that like too lazy to cook. It said they're too lazy people too lazy to learn and make time and that's really sad because time is actually one of the biggest things I hear people say they don't have and it's actually not time at all. It's just not their priority. We have to Value something to prioritize it like I value my health. It's mine. One priority because we thought that I feel like I can't do anything. Like if I was thinking bad I can't do anything. Right and a lot of people were only realized that when they've gone through something the rain sick or they can't have something and then they're like, oh my God took my health for granted and all, you know, they've ignored little signs that they've body that their body has been telling them. That's like being calling them like please look ask me more feed me better do this better and then your body's got to like Chuck this big storm of something else in just to be like, oh my god. Listen to me and that's so true because so many people were like, I need to do this myself, but I don't have time. I like this another whole conversation of how much how much we value ourselves to give ourselves time to do things for ourselves. but that's a problem in a society that we I think my belief don't value our health enough because if we did we wouldn't trade our money so much for convenience, but that's the thing like you only will not do that. If you value it so much because when you value it, you take more time and care to it. So and in saying that like it's okay when someone This is doing it for you. Like we never have to always cook ourselves and go shopping ourselves because I get fed by I go out and my family feeds me too. But I'm talking overall as a whole like daily. The least we can do is have an understanding of what we're feeding ourselves and how to feed ourselves where we can go to feed ourselves. So if I was to get you to see Through My Lens today, I'd say look and see everything as if it's feeding your mind body and energy, especially your food because it is and especially your energy to let's talk about that because it's uncommon to hear how important it is because we have all heard that you know, what you surround yourself with you become so if we're talking about that with foods to then what environment do you surround yourself with when you're eating Let's think about someone's food that you love. For me, that's my mom and my grandma keep that image in mind. And why do we love that food? Because it tastes good gear. But even if it's basic food is good, right because why it's cooked with love again. There is care and passion that goes into feeding you like they actually want to feed you that's their priority they care about you. They like they want to feed your good food when it comes to Cafes, for example, we accept like bad behavior because we want to be served and we don't have to do that and digest that because that's that bad behavior. We're digesting we're digesting that like, I don't give a shit. I'm going through Macker drive-through, or I'm going to go to this Cafe to the lady doesn't even smile to me or just because I like their food, but you are you're eating that that's where you're surrounding yourself that energy is going into your your food and you're allowing that to affect you and This might sound a bit crazy to you. But if you've never thought about this before, but if you pay attention to a next time you go into a place you will notice it. You'll notice how you digest your food differently when someone's made it with love and care and they respect you and they actually have your best interest in mind. But so till you become conscious of what you're eating. That energy of that person so about that pause. I got a call and I had to had to hang that up that beer till you become conscious of where you're eating that energy that person is going into your food. So isn't it? Nice like when you see someone love what they're making or their local family business there a cafe there restaurant they care they are passionate friendly all those things. Like that's where I like to support. That's why I like to sit down. Didn't eat where they asked me. Do you like your food? Like what do you want some more water? Like what do you know and they're one is really truly serve. You don't hate their jobs and like I get it there's some waitresses that can be nasty or whatever and they're just having a bad day, but that's not good enough because when you're in the hospitality industry, which I've worked in, so I feel like I can see this you put your shit aside because you're serving that person that person is in your best interest. You want to give them a good experience. And so when you go to a cafe next go with your gut feeling and lately, I've been like I always am just like, you know what I've already walked in here. It's rude to leave. It's not rude to leave because if I've sat down that person that hasn't said hello to me love give me water or even shown initiative to care then what's going into the food. And that's a that's a big bun for me now because I haven't even gone many of I have like probably three places. They love to eat because of the people because then I know when the people are so good. So the bloody food like it's so freaking important and it's not hard to notice. When you go out next pay attention like to the environment of the people and you'll see that's what you're feeding yourself to not just the food. And so if we become conscious of where we're eating, what about where we're shopping for our food? This is a big one and I think this will blow your mind. If you don't already think like this, I like to say like a back in the day. That's how I try to live now. Like that's how I've kind of grown up already like I grew vegetables and people think that's harder than it is, but that's definitely a whole nother topic. But you don't have to go veggies. Think about like what I said before where you go to the communities where the places where you like to eat that serve you well, and if you know me, you know how much I love to shop and cook for food. I share a lot of that on my Instagram and or if you know me in person, you know how much I love cooking like I look for excuses to cook if I'm not already doing it, so I love to shop at. Farmers markets local food shops just for like basic stuff. I personally do that because when I put myself in that environment I get what I need, it's literally as simple as that and those places that I'm going to have all you need literally, they only stock with a value which is fresh fruit and vegetables pastors meets, you know, like all the nutrient dense foods legumes legumes are I don't think that's how you say it. All the stuff that's like honestly all we need back to like the good old days where that's all you had like a caveman diet I'd say and that's what he lived off because I believe that's all we need. Whereas when you put yourself in an environment like will words or coals. Of course, you're going to be sucked into all the distractions like the two dollar tips and like all that's on sale because obviously it's all just like marketing to us to our laziness and to how much we love. Well we never really did have to but how much of being convinced to love sales and shit that we just don't need just because it looks good. So like everything even if you do shop there with an untrained eye though. It's easy to do that. But keep in mind that all you need is in that veggie area. It's always on like the left or right to bullies you walk in. First of all, does it fruit and veggies because that's most likely what you're going to need to buy and then everything else is that you just luring you into all the shit that you don't need. So that's why it's important to also keep your environment to like the basic places. And I love farmers markets because I'm supporting Farmers good people people that are like they're passionate about their work. They're working with the land. They are like God they just amazing like thank God for them because we simply have to create our own culture of going out there supporting them seeing them. They tell you how to cook the food half the time the fruit and veg or whatever it is because their passion and they like to to talk to people whereas like that cult that's not really the culture wars and Kohl's and just like I appreciate the culture like that. So that's why I personally do that and I like to experience and see what's out there and I like to have a conversation to so that's why I like I love Byron Bay so much actually because they don't have like the big chains there and they support all of those small companies and just just like Average people but yeah, I guess like the everyday people that are like trying to make a difference in the world. They don't even have him Bombay like a McDonald's that's how like supportive they are of good fresh food and they their culture is amazing. Like they have their farmers markets once a week, which Melbourne does to the only thing with Melbourne is you do have to travel out at least I'd say 20 minutes from your area. Well where I am. Anyway, I'm in the western suburbs. So generally you do have to travel a little bit. But if it's higher priority than that's inconvenience for you, but if you love it, and if you think look how much I can get out of this then of course you're going to go because you know that you're doing good for the environment and you're also looking after yourself because you care to get out there and see what they've got and cook with it and like learn a thing or two. But the thing is most people especially in my generation of people they would rather spend 20 minutes to 45 minutes to an hour going out to a club in the city then educating themselves on what they're eating and going out to a farmers market and you know what who cares not everyone has to do that, but for people that do care and are looking to be like Do I go and how do I educate myself more and avoid going to Coles and woolies and buying unnecessary shit and just like all those things that I've spoken about then that's where you start. Make it a priority be like, you know what I'm getting up on this Saturday. Like why would I sleep in and let's go and see how I can feed myself better and feel better and be more alive because I'm going to go shop for real Whole Foods and or I'm just going to be like, you know what I'm quitting woolies and calls for a week. Please have like give yourself a bit of a challenge. Where can I go? Who can I support? What are they got out there and like I'm constantly trying to do that to be like, you know instead of like I go to I go to a bakery that's like five minutes from my house and buy my bread there because they bake it there and there's so kind in there and I would rather that then go to Wally's and spend like $5.00 on a loaf of That has no nutrients and that's and I don't even know who's made it as well because I'm like that. I like to like get to the bottom of everything. I want to know what the hell is in everything. I don't wanna spend my money on a random company that does not align with my value. So what do you value? How much do you value your health? It's a very bitter they're very I was going to say but he's so so valuable that I can't even talk about it think about it and Don't make it too hard. Like if you go out somewhere just starts up a little bit more attention. I'm just start to think about how you feel when you're there or the environment feels like these are all things that you're feeding yourself and it's not just your food to like these are topics. I'm going to speak more about like yourself people places things what you're wearing on my God so many things but till then I hope you've enjoyed today's episode and I look, To speaking again. Hopefully you listening to me again. So it's not here. I've recorded this late. So have a good night all day wherever you're at, whatever time and thank you for tuning in and listening to me. And also thank you for listening to the cranky probably volume and voice whatever have it comes out in your ends because it's still a little bit weird for me being my first episode speaking to a phone because I'm usually conversing with people and also, So taking breaths in between because it's not it doesn't flowers easier when you're speaking to a phone. So thanks for putting up with that and I will catch you on the next episode follow my Instagram if you want to hear a little bit more see little bit more what I'm doing and yeah, I'll catch up.\",\n",

I'm Vanessa Richardson every day. We tell a timely story from True Crime history then analyze the historical impact of that day's events today. I'm diving into the story of Arles K Perry. I'm excited to provide an update on the case since it was covered in the park asked original unsolved murders due to the graphic nature of today's crimes listener discretion is advised we advise Caution for children under 13 today we're going back to October 13 1974 when 19 year old Arliss K. Perry was murdered just after midnight in the Stanford Memorial Church the disturbing nature of her death LED some to theorize that she was murdered as part of a perverse Satanic ritual, but the real killer turned out to be much closer to home. The late night air was crisp but Arliss was hot with anger. She hurried down one of Stanford's lamp-lit walking paths trying to put some distance between her and her husband Bruce. She loved him dearly after all she had followed him to California after she graduated from high school earlier that summer but he could be so hard-headed. Why did he care so much about meaningless things like how much air pressure she In their car tires Arliss looked back stopping to watch Bruce huff and puff as he ran to catch up to her deep down. She knew his stubbornness came from a place of love Bruce was extremely protective of her and just wanted to make sure she was safe so much so that he had insisted on accompanying her to drop some letters at the post office. Yes. It was after 11:00 p.m. But it was only a short walk from their dorm. A few moments later Bruce was backed by her side and they continued their walk home in silence. But even though she was still mad at him. She was glad he was there. Although Stanford wasn't considered to be dangerous three people had been murdered on campus in the past two years Arliss felt much safer with Bruce by her side. She knew there spat about the car tires was the sort of Tif married couples had all the time. But she still needed a moment to decompress Arliss stopped walking when they reached a Crossroads in the path. She told Bruce she wanted to go spend some time alone at the Stanford Memorial Church a devout Christian. Arliss always felt better after a prayer session. Bruce was hesitant to leave her on her own. But he knew she needed some space. He went on to their dorm while Arliss headed for the church. She got there a few minutes before midnight Arliss took a deep calming breath as she took a seat in a Pew she loved how the moon light filtered in through the stained glass windows some might find it spooky. She thought it was peaceful. Back at the dorm Bruce waited up for Arliss. He hated going to bed angry, but as the Clock Struck twelve fifteen am he started to get worried Arliss said she was only going to stop at the church for a few minutes. She should have been home already when Bruce went to the church to check on her the doors were locked. He headed back to the dorm thinking he must have somehow mr. On her way home, but Carlos wasn't there either for the next few hours Bruce drove around campus all concerns over tire pressure gone from his head. He wondered where on Earth his wife could be their argument wasn't so bad that she wouldn't have come home. Plus there wasn't really any where else she could have gone arlis had only moved out to California in August and hadn't made any good friends yet. He was certain. She wouldn't be visiting anyone. So Into the night Bruce looked everywhere. He traced every conceivable path. Arliss could have taken to get home. He checked all the secluded spots. She could have gone to think after leaving the church. He kept replaying their fight in his mind wishing. He could take back everything. He said he just wanted to hold his wife in his arms and say he was sorry by 3 a.m. Bruce realized he wasn't going to find his his wife on his own a few officers went to the church and confirmed. It was locked. They assumed something must have happened to her as she walked back home while the police searched the area a security guard named Stephen Crawford arrived at the church around 5:45 a.m. To open it for the day to Crawford surprise. The door was unlocked Crawford was worried he had Lee close the church the night before around 12 10 a.m. He had called out for anyone still inside to come out before he locked the doors. Luckily. It didn't seem like anything was stolen from the church's altar. But as Crawford headed back down the aisle something caught his eye in the East transept just to the left of the altar it was Arliss Perry's body. The scene was too horrific to believe Arliss laid spread eagle on her back with a 5 and a half inch icepick protruding from her skull her jeans and underwear had been pulled off and a two-foot altar candle forced inside her Arliss is blouse had also been torn open and is second candle rested between her breasts Crawford immediately called the police and they Rush To the crime scene. They were able to collect a partial palm print from one of the candles as well as a semen sample that was found on a nearby kneeling pillow. Although DNA testing wasn't yet available. It was a valuable piece of physical evidence. When the police went to tell Bruce what had happened he opened the door covered in blood. He insisted that it was his as he got severe nosebleeds whenever he was stressed nevertheless. He instantly became the prime suspect. However blood type testing showed that it was in fact Bruce has blood on his shirt and not Arliss has the palm print found on the candle also wasn't a match. Additionally Bruce agreed to submit to a polygraph test and passed without any issues. Although polygraphs aren't necessarily a reliable indication of Innocence or guilt the police were satisfied enough to cross Bruce off as a suspect the other suspect. The police questioned was the security guard Stephen Crawford like Bruce Crawford's Palm didn't match the partial print found on the candle and he also so passed a polygraph. It seemed like Arliss Perry's murder would forever remain unsolved. Up next a shocking break in the case now back to the story. as the years went by after Arliss Perry's 1974 murder the Cold Case unit in the Santa Clara District Attorney's Office routinely reviewed the case, but New Leads weren't forthcoming theories of who killed 19 year old Arliss Perry ran rampant some suspected that she was killed in some sort of Satanic ritual famed Son of Sam serial killer David Berkowitz hinted that he knew Who killed Arliss but he didn't provide any useful information until recently. It seemed like Arliss is killer would never be identified. But in 2018 the police made a breakthrough. Due to advances in forensic technology detectives were able to conclusively identify the DNA left at the crime scene in 2018. It belonged to Stephen Crawford the security guard who claimed to have discovered our Lisa's body to be certain he had committed the murder the police conducted several interviews with Crawford throughout June 2018 by the end of the month. They were confident enough to file an Just warrant. Once the warrant was granted officers quickly drove to Crawford's apartment to place him under arrest once Crawford heard the police announce themselves. He took his fate into his own hands. He killed himself before he could be arrested. Unfortunately this meant the police weren't ever able to get insight into why Crawford had killed Arliss or understand why he had killed her. In such a sickening way. Although Bruce Parry never got the satisfaction of seeing his wife's murderer. Go to jail. Finally learning who killed her must have been a tremendous relief to often cold cases such as these go unsolved grieving families. Never find the Comfort they seek but in the case of Arles K Perry, her loved ones can at least take solace in the fact that the man who ended her life in such a brutal way. I can no longer hurt anyone else. It's a small justice, but Justice all the same.

We're exploring Scandal number of 53 the mid Ott's prostitution Saga that rocked Washington DC in 2007 Debra Jean palfrey better known as the DC Madam was indicted for racketeering and money laundering her escort services Client List included. From the highest reaches of the US government ranging all the way into the dark Halls of the White House and her death by hanging in 2008 two weeks after her guilty verdict called into question. Just how far the corruption ran. By 2006 50 year-old Debra Jean pelphrey had been running Pamela Martin and Associates for 13 years. She had a good thing going her client list included everyone in town who mattered from Pentagon advisors to Senators to the deputy secretary of state. She'd served as many as 15,000 clients around 80% of whom were repeat customers. She had built up a great group of gals. She called them to they were almost all college-educated women older than 23 and ranging up into their 50s. They all had day jobs or were in school. And while many of them were pretty What mattered more to Deborah was their Poise their slim figures and what she called there and Taylor style sophisticated women for sophisticated clients. It was a very different kind of operation than the one she tried to set it up in San Diego in the late 80s. She'd started in good faith after trying out escort work herself to supplement her income as an interior designer. She was quote appalled and disgusted by how CD lazy and incompetent most escort agencies were but her first foray into running her own escort agency was a failure. She made little mistakes left and right police had caught on to the fact That her operation stumbled across the Thin Line separating legal escort work and illegal prostitution an escort could pedal sexual fantasy and stay on the right side of the law. But as soon as she engaged in anything considered by local courts to be an illegal sex act she could be prosecuted the mistakes of Deborah's first escort agency. However, Were Far Away by now way back. back in 1992 Now Deborah had experience as well as her college degree and excellent work ethic and she had a better playing Ground while she ran her operation by phone from Vallejo, California. All her business took place in DC and DC. Unlike San Diego was chock-full of her Target clientele those clients appreciated that she never asked for their real names the so-called. Al's meanwhile like that, she never forced them to take more jobs than they wanted and that as long as she got her 50% of their official fee. She never asked for a cut of their tips in short things couldn't have been going better at least not on the surface, but this was Washington and Washington under a conservative president to boot George W bush had been in office for the past six years and his administration was Exactly friendly to sex workers Randall L Tobias at that time. The United States director of foreign aid and a deputy secretary of state was one example, although he didn't create the policy that said in order to receive us Aid you had to denounce sex work? That would be Congress Tobias is background wasn't in policymaking at all. He worked in Big Business Pharmaceuticals and at AT&T. T until George W bush nominated him to be the United States Global AIDS coordinator in 2003 Tobias was a Christian Midwestern Republican the conservative anti-prostitution requirements that Congress had tied to the foreign aid fund were in line with his own values in an interview with PBS Tobias explained the Congress. I think very appropriately has put into the legislation. That organizations in order to receive money need to have a policy opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking. I don't think it's too difficult for people to be opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking which are in fact to contributing causes to the spread of HIV/AIDS Tobias and is office weren't alone in there publicly negative view of sex work DC in the mid oughts was a risky environment for running an escort service. Deborah in response was careful. She never explicitly referenced anything illegal on the phone with her employees or the John's she talked exclusively about sexual fantasy never specific sex acts and it was specifically exchanging sex acts for money that was illegal according to the DC laws regarding sex work Debra hoped making sure her business never referenced them should be enough to keep Keep her safe, but she had a backup safety net to. Deborah was reassured by the fact that Randall Tobias like many other lawmakers across the political Spectrum was her client conservatives like Tobias might be condemning prostitution on the political stage, but that hypocrisy gave them all the more reason to want their illicit extracurricular activities to stay in the shadows a sex scandal could crush a political career instantly. And not just because sex work was for the most part illegal. It was all so embarrassing and for conservatives elected on platforms emphasizing traditional Christian values infidelity in general and prostitution in particular were ungodly moral indiscretions voters were unlikely to excuse them. So Deborah hoped if all else failed and law enforcement started to pursue a case against Pamela Martin, Associates her John's would step in and bury the case. If not to protect her then to protect themselves because they were everywhere the judicial system the Army government agencies of every kind as well. As of course on Capitol Hill Debra may have been right to hope that her many powerful John's would keep any investigations into her business from getting very far case in point. meat being the trajectory of the investigation launched in 2001 or rather the lack thereof the Postal Service noticed an unusually high number of money orders being delivered to Debra's PO Box in San Diego in 2001 coming from about 25 women, but it took the federal government all of three years to start investigating this Oddity then even after the investigation launched In June 2004 it moved slowly if it was the protection of some powerful Washington customer that's slowed down the investigation. However, his power eventually reached its limits in October 2006 two years after the investigation launched law enforcement got a search warrant for Deborah's Vallejo, California home. They raided her papers and seized almost half a million dollars worth of assets. 51 year-old Deborah was on vacation in Germany when the warrant was issued and the raid carried out but she didn't stay away. She was confident that this Saga was only just beginning and that when it finally ended she would win she had several reasons to think that first of all there were her precautions. She'd never explicitly spoken with the girls about sex and her contracts with them actually forbid both. Iterative and oral sex which were what the law most regularly defined as sex acts. There was absolutely no proof that she knew about illegal activities occurring under her auspices if some of her girls were having sex that was their own problem not hers. Then there were her phone records investigators had failed to seize them out of her Dusty basement when they searched her home and she felt sure these records Would prove to be an important bargaining chip. Meanwhile the prosecution was assembling its own Arsenal in exchange for immunity from prosecution. They got 15 Jane Doe's on record saying they had sex with clients while working for Pamela Martin & Associates these women admitted that they never discussed sex explicitly with Deborah or Julie as they knew her, but they were all confident that I knew what was going on and her euphemisms about sexual fantasy were simply to protect her from prosecution in exactly a situation like this investigators also found copies of Deborah's newsletters, which she emailed to her girls regularly, these newsletters detailed tips tricks and guidelines the women should follow while at work. They shouldn't drink or do drugs. They should always lock the door. Double and triple lock it when with clients they should let the men undress first precautions like the triple door locks certainly hinted the Deborah knew something untoward was happening while the girls were on her clock and the references to undressing certainly sounded like precursors to sex statements like the following looked particularly damning quote adult service or fantasy escorts command a substantially. Greater fee usually $200 an hour this of course because of the risky and sexual nature of these appointments. Obviously the more liberal the booking or act the more money one makes therefore if anyone thinks that fantasy prices can ever be charged for purely Social Services. All this writer can say is that the person is a damned fool this past weekend this new escort no longer. Amongst us thought she could go there collect the $200 and just talk her mere presence being justification enough here for the big bucks wrong. It certainly sounds like she's encouraging her girls to have sex with clients. Although it's notable that she never explicitly says anything about penetrative or oral sex and sexual can cover a whole range of legal activities to Deborah also, Sighs these kinds of statements in her newsletters by explaining quote the misogynists get a real kick out of surprising shocking you and we're not doing anything wrong, but they sure as heck try to make anything we do into something wrong whether or not she was referring to illegal sex acts Deborah made it clear that the moral judgments of wrong in this industry came from a misogynistic perspective law enforcement hated. To see women using their sexuality for personal gain and would do whatever they could to punish them for it first and foremost by labeling the woman's Behavior wrong while ignoring Men's Central role in The Exchange how moral versus legal wrong fit together here is unclear, but Deborah was sure of one thing. She knew how easily those definitions could be and were manipulated by people in power. Regardless of the nuances in these texts on March 1st, 2007 Debra was indicted and she was right to speculate that misogyny as well as the Privileges of power would dictate how her activities were perceived by the public and treated by the legal system, but she was more than ready to fight back. Coming up we'll delve into the dramatic battle between Deborah and the courts now back to the story on March 1st, 2007 51 year-old Debra Jean palfrey or the DC Madam as the papers dubbed. Her was indicted by a Washington DC grand jury, the case included charges of racketeering and money laundering, but Deborah was ready to meet the courts challenge. Legal strategy was to maintain that if her employees did anything illegal during their appointments. It was without her knowledge, but she also had another strategy. She was going to convince Washington and all of the US that if there was anyone to blame here. It was her powerful clients who abuse their status as elected officials and policymakers by breaking the laws. They were meant to uphold and the conservative family. Values Republicans amongst them had hypocritically abandoned the Christian morality. They were trying to force on America to boot that should be enough to ruin a few political careers and take the attention off of her and any crimes she was accused of if they'd had sex with her girls. That is meanwhile, if they maintained like her that her service wasn't meant for sex, but rather for legal sexual fantasy. Then they could serve as Witnesses for her defense. It was a win-win either way. All she had to do was find a way to make her clients names public despite the fact that she didn't know many of their names, but she did know their phone numbers Deborah announced to the press that she would sell her phone records to the highest bid in news agency. These records contain 10,000. To 15,000 clients phone numbers and while she didn't know the real names behind all of those numbers. She knew a news agency had the resources to find out but she didn't stop there. She also in court documents outed one client whose name she did know Harlan K Omen. She chose this candidate carefully all men was an academic whose claim to fame. Name was a scholarly paper. He wrote on Military strategy coining the term shock and awe a term later used in the US war in Iraq. Thanks to his prestige in Washington circles Ullman demonstrated. The caliber of Deborah's clients, but she also chose him because he was in her words an unpleasant man. She didn't feel guilty about exposing his indiscretions to family and friends as well as the Can people Omens response was dismissive he stated that the accusation doesn't deserve the Dignity of a response, but it's certainly had the desired effect of getting Washington talking. According to Debra's lawyer Montgomery Blair Sibley five other lawyers contacted him asking whether their clients names were in Deborah's phone records and some Sibley claimed asked if anything could be done to ensure their identities State private. Debra's plan was working. She was in control of the narrative and the public was listening when in late March she handed her records. To ABC the entire city was on edge breathless for the results of the news agency's investigation some because they knew their numbers were on the list. But everyone else wanted to know to this was a salacious drama and one that washingtonians understood could have very real consequences on the government Washington in the spring of 2007 was no stranger. Jerr to sex Teenage Drama less than 2 years before a major Scandal had rocked the capital in the form of corruption charges against Republican Congressman Randy Duke Cunningham. Those charges had focused on monetary Kickbacks the congressman received from defense contractors, but there were hints that he'd been paid in escort services to a black mark against a Christian in a case that was already Extremely Bleak the result of the Scandal was Cunningham's resignation and a tense runoff election that almost cost Republicans the seed and of course, no one could forget the 1998 Bill Clinton impeachment Scandal. It wasn't just Family Values Republicans who are vulnerable to censure for sexual misconduct. The Democratic president was almost removed from office after lying under oath about an extramarital affair. R. A good sex scandal could bring down almost any politician thanks to the genres Perfect Storm of immorality and at least in cases involving prostitution illegality. The city was anxious to know who this new drama might take down in part because of the gossiping nature of the information but in part because it had the potential to shift around the key players in Washington's high-stakes political games. April passed slowly in the capital as ABC's researchers slogged through 46 Pounds of phone records, but finally in late April events started to pick up speed. ABC announced that amongst Debra's clients were senior business Executives NASA officials, and at least five Military Officers then on April 26th, the network called Randall Tobias deputy secretary of state and a married man and asked him to confirm that he used Debra's escort service mortified. He admitted that he had but just for massages in fact, he added He had lately been using a different service for massages one, which provided Central American gals as he called them that little detail did nothing to help his case and the massage bit in general fell flat few people believed him plus his record of withholding foreign aid from countries with legalized sex work made the whole Affair look even worse. He was a hypocrite on top of breaking the law. The day after ABC called on April 27th. 2007 Tobias resigned Debra's plan wasn't working perfectly. It didn't look great for her case that the public dismissed tobias's massage claims out of hand, but her other angle had worked Tobias was the bad guy and by handing over her Client List. She was starting to look like an avenging Angel fight. For rule of law over dirty politicians her quotes to that effect circulated around the nation's papers including I abhor Injustice on any level and in any Forum, I frankly persist despite life's barriers, and I never could stomach Injustice social or otherwise, she was the feminist the woman prosecuted for tiny errors where men got away with murder. And in the fall of 2007 with President George W. Bush's conservative government struggling to keep approval ratings above 30% that more liberal mindset was getting decent traction. But then ABC stopped naming names they announced that no one else in the phone records was newsworthy and they weren't quote going to out low-level analysts in the Pentagon. This is 20/20 not the Pentagon times on top of that the US District Court for the District of Columbia issued a protective order blocking the release of the phone records to prevent the potential. Intimidation of witnesses. This was not the plan if more men weren't named Deborah might not get any John's to testify. They certainly wouldn't come forward of their own accord to save her. But if they were outed, they'd have a reason to take the stand and corroborate her claims that her agency didn't provide any illegal sexual Services doing so would clear their names as well as hers and on. Top of that without more hypocritical government boys to point at the public would forget her message the bad guys here were the men Deborah Furious determined that ABC was bowing to pressure from the government. She knew there were more newsworthy names on the list at least a hundred she told reporters. She just had to get it out to other researchers, but thanks to the court order. She couldn't With the help of her lawyer she did everything possible to get that court order lifted and on July 5th. Finally she did within an hour of receiving the judges revision Deborah and her lawyer had 50 CD-ROMs in the mail on their way to journalists around the country each one containing the entirety of her phone records. Then she listed the same telephone numbers publicly on her website. It took only a few days. Is for journalists to turn up another name that they deemed newsworthy, Louisiana Senator David Vitter. Elected on a conservative Family Values platform Vitter like Tobias before him was an ironic figured to appear on Deborah's list. He responded. However with more Poise than Tobias had sending out a well worded statement on July 9th. This was a very serious sin in my past for which I am of course completely responsible several years ago. I asked for and received forgiveness from God. My wife in confession and marriage counseling out of respect for my family. I will keep my discussion of the matter there with God and them but I certainly offer my deep and sincere apologies to all I have disappointed and let down in any way this statement and an ensuing July 16th, press conference helped Vitter Garner support from other Republicans enough support that he wasn't pressured to resign from his post like Tobias had been in fact, he kept his seat in the Senate until 2017 when he retired from public office vitter's success marked a turning point in Deborah's campaign against the government when journalists failed to turn up any more names they deemed newsworthy. She started to shift her angle of attack to another aspect of the case the fact that her escort agency and only her Agency was being prosecuted the government Deborah announced was conspiring against her. Coming up. We'll hear about Debra's final fight with the courts and the dramatic aftermath of her trial now back to the story. In the fall of 2007 Debra Jean palfrey decided it was time for a new line of attack against the courts and the government they were Prosecuting her for running a prostitution ring and the case wasn't about any single client as she explained in an interview. This case is not about Louisiana Senator David Vitter rather. It was about the fact that she could and did list over. Atdc escort agencies in her court filings, but none of them were under investigation why her she demanded of journalists and of the courts what had brought her agency to the attention of the government when they were so uninterested in the other escorts servicing Washington's Elite some journalists felt. She was losing her grip as she repeated these questions again and again sounding more conspiratorial with Every complaint her agency just happened to be the one that investigators received a tip about unfortunately Justice was never universally evenly applied, but the questions started to feel more relevant as Debra's case dragged on and the parallel case emerged in, New York. Starting in October 2007 Federal investigators were in fact investigating another escort service Emperor's Club VIP the investigation which the New York Times announced to the public in March 2008 caused a media flurry not dissimilar to Debra's likely because it too involved a prominent political figure Eliot Spitzer or client number nine. fine as The Emperor's Club called him was at the center of the investigation but there was a major difference between the Emperor's Club and Deborah's operation Debra's service charge $300 an hour compared to the upwards of $1,000 an hour build by The Emperor's Club while Deborah cleared around two million dollars over the course of 13 years running her business The Emperor's Club made 1 million dollars in just for years, which is to say while Debra's hourly rate put the minimum wage to shame her operation was in the world of high-class escort businesses comparatively modest. So why was her little operation one of only two escort services under investigation? She demanded surely the government had other bigger fish to fry fish that were in the league of The Emperor's Club this emphasis on the modesty of her operation was certainly a different tactic than her earlier defense which focused on just how prominent and Powerful her clients were but one part of her original defense remained unchanged. The courts were treating her case misogynistic lie Deborah railed against the fact that while many of her former employees were called to the stand convinced to testify with Promises of immunity. None of her customers testified and going public with escort work was incredibly difficult these women faced stigma and shame in the public sphere and for many of them in their personal lives. One of the former escorts Brandi Britain was so devastated by the process that she died of suicide in 2007 before she could be brought to the stand. Deborah wasn't particularly sympathetic about Randy's death. In fact, she told the Press I guess I made of something that Brandi Britain wasn't made of but the death was just another example proving her Point as usual while men were getting off scot-free the women were paying a terrible price, but the jury in the end wasn't convinced by Debra's claim that the government was persecuting her nor were they interested in her high-level arguments about the gendered application of Justice? They didn't buy her argument that she had been blissfully ignorant of her employees illegal sexual Services either on April 15 2008 the jury found D 2 year-old Deborah guilty of money laundering using the mail for illegal purposes and racketeering. Her maximum sentence was 55 years though. Sentencing guidelines would likely put the final number closer to six years. Deborah was devastated. She was immediately taken back to her 1991 conviction and the Terrors of her time in jail, one of her fellow inmates would punch you Her throat and face everyday 18 months had felt endless. She'd lost her spirit and her gumption now remembering that experience with despair. She did a 180 on her comments about her former employee Brandi Britain suicide. She told her friend and journalists Dan moldea. I'm not going back to jail. I'll kill myself first. I'll commit suicide. Side first it was in this state of Anguish that Deborah traveled from DC down to Tarpon Springs, Florida where her mother lived while awaiting sentencing. It was late April already warm and sticky in the Waterfront town a world away from Washington and the chaos of Deborah's last year how this change of scenery affected Debra's mental state remains one of the biggest mysteries. Is of her story it may have proved steadying her despair at the jury's guilty verdict may have started to fade and her determination to survive. This Scandal may have strengthened things had changed since she went to jail in 1991 after all she'd run a successful business for 13 years. She'd made a respectable amount of money for herself. She'd come into her own and remember the vehement some of her comment. Her former employees suicide. I guess I made of something that Brandy Britain wasn't made of she was proud of the strength. She'd one for herself and dismissive of what she deemed to be weakness. Plus she was still highly suspicious of government forces conspiring against her that kind of Injustice and mystery was motivational for a fighter like Debra Jean but despite all that on May. First two weeks after her conviction Deborah was found hanged in a shed behind her mother's home. The police report deemed the death a suicide but immediately suspicions erupted in Washington and around the country Deborah after all had said that she was made of something that her former employee. Britain wasn't made of plus. It was odd for two women involved with the same case to both died by hanging especially considering its a less common suicide. It for women Deborah had kept the most private secrets of many powerful men Skeptics wondered if there was some secret that was too dangerous to let out something bigger than Ullman Tobias and Vitter but there are some issues with this speculation. First of all Deborah left to suicide notes in her own distinctive writing style and second of all, it's difficult to hang someone else. Else and make it look like suicide but it's certainly possible to coerce someone into writing a suicide note and hanging himself. There is a bigger issue with the idea that Deborah was killed to ensure her silence. However, if she was still sitting on some enormous secret why had she kept quiet about it, not only through her trial but for two weeks after her conviction, it could be that she had no idea the information. She was sitting On she didn't after all know the names of all of her clients, but if she didn't know what until she had then killing her was a bit premature we have however had a recent suggestion that perhaps there was at least one more piece of important information buried in Debra's files in February. 2016 Montgomery Blair Sibley Debra's former lawyer attempted to lift a seven restraining order that bars him from releasing more of Deborah's records. He claimed that they contain information relevant to the 2016 presidential election the Supreme Court, however, rejected Sibley's request whatever information he wanted to share stayed hidden during the 2016 elections and so the fascinating final mystery of the DC madam remains unsolved whatever secrets are hidden in Debra's grave her impact on a particular cultural moment isn't debatable her case captivated Washington during an era when family values and morality were at center stage of conservative politics in 2008 the same year of Deborah's death Sarah Palin would represent the religious right and tea party sensibilities on the Republican Presidential ticket, just like Randy do Cunningham's corruption Scandal Debra's case sparked discussions about the hypocrisy of lawmakers who fell far short of the values. They preached it also spurred conversations about gender power and the uneven application of Justice. Well one out of the three men Debra's case publicly implicated to bias lost his job. The other two were largely unaffected by the scandal in the long term Omen can't Continues to write books his most recent was published in 2017 and work in the private sector Vitter retired from the Senate just two years ago and now works as a lobbyist the men are doing all right, the women on the other hand didn't fare as well. Deborah is as we've discussed dead along with Brandi Britain one of her employees another woman outed as an escort during the case lost her day job. in the military in the 11 years since Debra's death American politics and cultural norms have shifted enormously but questions of corruption powerful people who behave like they're Above the Law are still Central to National debates sex work meanwhile remains illegal in most parts of the United States, but some sex workers are actively trying to change that and their fight Is gaining momentum we can see the legacy of the DC Madam refracted through all of this 2008 wasn't after all very long ago. Next week coming in at number 52 on our countdown. We'll look at a scandal involving some of the very same issues back in the 1790s. The Hamilton Reynolds Affair was one of the very first sex scandals in American political history at first Alexander Hamilton tried to hide his indiscretions by paying up his blackmail money, but eventually as other dark corrupt secrets were tied.

       " \"The men and women in the Bible were great people, but they were also real people who had feelings, trials, problems, and questions—just like you. There is nothing wrong with asking God how long you will need to wait to see your prayers answered. So what do you do in the meantime when you have not seen them come to pass? This empowering and inspiring message will show you what you can expect to happen when you learn to trust God. You will also learn how to see with His perspective, have patience, and have biblical persistence to see His restoration in your life. Welcome to the Gregory dig out podcast.

You know, we think of we think of the men in the Bible in the women in the Bible. We think of them as such great people such amazing people and they are but they were real people and they had real feelings like we have and they had real trials like we have and they had real problems like we have and they had real questions like we have and so in Psalm chapter 13, we get a little glimpse of David's Humanity. Yeah. This is the same guy in Psalm 13. This is the same guy that killed the lion the same guy that killed the bear the same guy that killed the giant the same guy that is called the the king. That was the that was the second king. But the real legitimate King of Israel was David is through David's lineage that Jesus was born David was a man after God's Own Heart. The Bible says David fulfilled God's purpose for his generation. David wrote Psalm 23 The Lord is my shepherd Psalm 51 about Lord take not your spirit from me restore to me the joy of my salvation David wrote Psalm 103 that bless the Lord O my soul for getting on his benefits who pardons all my iniquities. He heals all my diseases. David is an awesome man. Can anybody say Amen? N but he's also the man that fell he's also the man at failed. He's also man the stumbled just like Peter just like Paul just like all of us have failed and Fallen but David asks this question here in Psalm 13 and says like we would say sometimes how long how long O Lord. Has anybody asked that how long O Lord like how long I'm going to have to wait before I see my prayer answered how long I'm going to have to wait before I get my Harvest how long I'm going to have to wait before you show up in my Situation Lord how long it's not it's not wrong to ask the question. It's wrong to doubt the one you're asking but it's not it's not wrong to doubt and wonder and ask him. So hey take your questions to God how long O Lord isn't it? Interesting that he had the same question. We have sometimes like man. Why is this taking so long? Why is this taking so long but notice who he asks how long O Lord. He's still his Lord. Jesus is still my Lord, even when I wonder even when I'm questioning even when I'm Worried even when I'm anxious even I'm not sure even I don't have the answer. I'm going to him with it how long O Lord and the notice what he says, how long are you going to forget me forever? This the guy killed the lion kill the bear killed the Giant and he's like Lord. How long are you going to forget me? It's okay to be human. It's okay to be human. How long are you going to forget me forever is sarcastic now now he's like a now he's like a little, you know, just a little sissy right now right forever. How long our look will you forget me forever? like attitude man How long will you hide your face from me? Anybody been there? How long shall I take counsel in my soul? How long is this sorrow going to last all day. How long will my enemy be exalted over me? Consider an answer me O Lord my God. Anybody been there God I need an answer. Somebody called me yesterday hadn't heard from in years and they said man. I need an answer I needed. I need a word from God. I need God to come through for me. I need a miracle. I need to hear from God. I need to hear David was like that. I need an answer Lord Enlighten my eyes. I need to see something. I can't see right now or I'll sleep the sleep of death. He's talking about depression here. Talking about suicide. He's gone through it. He's going through something. Hey, never never never beat yourself up because you had bad thoughts never beat yourself up because you had thoughts of depression never beat yourself up because you thought about losing your life or taking your life. I'm not asking you I'm asking you please don't do it. But look, it's okay to ask those questions. It's okay to struggle. It's okay to go through Seasons. It's okay to go through dark times as long as you know who you're talking to. Consider an answer me O Lord my God enlighten me or I'll sleep the sleep of death and my enemy will say I have overcome him and my adversaries will rejoice when I'm Shakin. So how long O Lord? and then at the end how long O Lord what what what's supposed to happen between the how long O Lord and the prayer being answered verse 5 gives us the answer to that question, but I have trusted but I have trusted but I've trusted but I've trusted but I've how long O Lord my enemies going to Rejoice over me, but I have trusted I feel such sorrow, but I have trusted I feel like giving up but I've trusted I feel like it's not going to work out but I've trusted my heart is sorry every day, but I've trusted in your steadfast love this word loving-kindness. Here is the word steadfast love no matter how no matter how much we fail at being faithful God never fails at being faithful his love never fails, but I've trusted in your steadfast love, you know, we're just we're just like David and we go through times and then he says in verse 6 So I will sing to the Lord because he has dealt bountifully with me what happens between verse 1 and verse 6 in verse 1 how long O Lord in verse 6 my God has come through for me. What happens in between what happens in the meantime is we got to turn our trust towards God the thing that gets the thing that connects verse 1 to verse 6 is trusting in his loving-kindness trusting in his steadfast love what connects you from? Oh God, how long O Lord to I will sing to you. Lord who brought me through what happens in between is that we trust God as we trust God trusting him and trusting his unfailing love is the bridge between verse 1 and verse 6. It's the bridge between how long O Lord and my gods come through for me. I will sing to the Lord because he has dealt bountifully with me. Hey who wants the first six in your life? I will sing to the Lord because he's dealt bountifully with me, but who's going through a verse one in your life? How long O Lord? Well, let me tell you the secret to connect these two things is Trust. Ting God's steadfast Love Is Love will not fail you. He will not relaxed his hold on you he will keep you in the palm of his hand and no weapon formed against you is going to prosper your God is going to deliver you. He's your God and he's going to bring you through all we gotta do is trust him. All we got to do is trust him. All we gotta do is trust him not lean on our own understanding but in all our ways acknowledge Him and He will make her he will make our paths straight, which means we must be on a crooked path. Like we are on a crooked if he's got a if he has got to make our paths straight that must mean that that our path is a little crooked and that's why he's got to make it straight. He doesn't make a straight path straight. He makes a crooked paths straight. That means some of us got some crooked paths. Some of us are on some crooked path. Some of us are some Crooks. But he said but he will make our path straight all that takes the pressure off of me. I don't have to make my path straight. I can't make my path straight, but he can make my past straight and he will make my path straight when I trust him and don't lean on my own understanding. I don't have to figure it all out. I don't have to understand it. All. I can't understand it all. I just know this how long O Lord and then I know this I'm going to sing to the Lord because he has delivered me. So all I know to do is connect those two verses with thanking him and praising him and believing in his loving kindness and his steadfast. That will not fail me. I will trust in your steadfast love. That's the bridge. That's the connector between how long and I will sing. The bridge is I will trust in your steadfast love he's going to come through for me not because of me but because of his steadfast love See, I'm not trusting my trust. I'm trusting his love. I'm trusting in his steadfast love and he'll make my path straight. I don't make it stretch. I can't make it but he can make it straight. I was acknowledged him. Oh look, see how David acknowledge Him even though David is he's pouring his heart out to God and he's telling us it's okay to have human emotions, but notice who he's talking to notice. Who's he who he's acknowledging like go through those Seasons like I go through those seasons. But Jesus is still Lord. I got sorrow sometimes but Jesus is still Lord. I got Financial issues. Sometimes with Jesus is still Lord. I got worries and anxieties sometimes but Jesus is still Lord. I'm not sure the answer but Jesus is still Lord. I'm not sure how it's going to happen. But Jesus is still Lord. I'm not sure how it's all going to work out. But Jesus is still Lon. I'm not sure who's going to be with me and who's going to be against me. But Jesus is still Lord. I don't know when the prayers going to be answered. But Jesus is still Lord. I don't know when it's going to happen in the doors can open. But Jesus is still Lord. You see that's acknowledging him in all your ways. He's my God. He who dwells in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty whose power? No foe can withstand. I will say of the Lord. He is my refuge. He is my Fortress. He is my God. And in him will I trust he is my God and in him will I trust somebody's got to say he's my God around. He's my God say he's my God. He's my God my God my God. Talking bout my God my god, dude. He's my God. You got to you got to acknowledge like acknowledging him David's like talking about his problem. But he's talking to Lord. He's acknowledging God but You O Lord will answer me, but you but I Sing To You O Lord O beloved. Listen, we take care of the trusting. And God will take care of the timing. We take care of the trusting. God will take care of the timing. Trust trust several things are going to happen when we trust him. I'm going to tell you about those in a minute, but let me give you a little like a picture of trust for a moment. So this guy named blondin was a French in France somewhere. He was he he was a Frenchman but he came over and he used to walk across the Niagara Falls on a tightrope and he's very well very famous. You can look him up. He used to walk across a tightrope and he'd walk to one side back to the other and one time. He was celebrating like his hundredth time walking this tightrope across the Niagara Falls. There are several people gathered and they were clapping and they were cheering and he said to them now how many of you he walks He Walks from one side and then he's going to walk back walk gets to the he gets to the other side and he's about to go back to their sides and how many believe that I can walk back to the other side and everybody said We believe We believe we just walked we just watched you walk to this side so we know you're going to be able to walk back and he said well how many of you really believe and they said we really believe we really believe and then he pointed to one man. He said well then get on my back and let's go. Guess what blond and walked alone that day? Because the man said he believed but he didn't trust. You see the difference now? He said he believed but he didn't trust so there's a guy that was hiking years ago. And he was by himself and he stumbled over Iraq. He's open this top top of this hill almost and he falls over the edge of this cliff and as he's falling grabs onto a branch that was sticking out of the cliff. He grabs onto the branch. Otherwise, he would have fallen to his death. He grabs onto the branch and he's holding on to dear life and he starts yelling up to the top of the hill and he says help is there anybody up there help? Is there anybody up there? He's yelling help. Is there anybody up there and all of a sudden he hears a voice and the voice says my Son my son it is I do not be afraid. Oh, wow. Is it you Lord? He said yes, it is me and here's what I want you to do. I want you to trust me and let go of the branch and the guy looked down then he looked up holding onto the branch. He said help. Is there anybody else up there? How many have been there? Is there anybody else up there? Oh Lord. Is there anybody wow, you see trust when we trust him? The following things will happen. Listen. This is a beautiful thing and Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 11 Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 11. Remember what it says it says in I want to read this to you from the King James Bible Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 11. He says he has made everything beautiful in his time. He makes everything beautiful in his time in his time in his time. He makes everything beautiful. Only this time there's something about trusting God's timing. There's something about trusting God that we take care of the trusting. He'll take care of the timing and when you really get to a place in your life where you really realize that God's not limited by our timetable. He's not limited by our deadlines. He's not limited to when our rent is due. He's not limited to what the doctor said. He's not limited to the three months the doctor gave you to live God's not limited to an time and space like in one day he can turn around years of frustration and in one moment, he can turn around years of unanswered prayer in one Split Second. He can answer everything you've ever asked see he's not limited to time and space. So we take care of the trusting he'll take care of the timing. He said he is made all things beautiful in his time. You see when you step into this place of trusting God trusting God leaning not on your own understanding but trusting that he will keep his word trusting in his faithfulness trusting in his goodness trusting that he will take care of you when you step into this place of trust when you step into this place of expectation of him you stop putting demands on On other people and people no longer become your problem and you're not mad at anybody else anymore because you're trusting God not people you're not your you love people but you're not trusting them. They are not taking the place of God for you. They are not taking the place of being your answer being your companion being your friend. Like Jesus will take care of all of that. Like I'm telling you it's good to have friends is good to have companions a good to have people in your life. But I'm telling you can't put your trust in them. They could turn on you they could betray you they could leave you they could die. They could MIT. They could misunderstand you they can get mad they can walk away. But God will never walk away. Our trust needs to be in God as long as I'm trusting God but loving you then you can't disappoint me. You cannot disappoint me because I'm not trusting you. I don't need you to behave a certain way for me to love you. I'm loving you because hey, this is how we walk. This is how we live. God loves me. So I'm going to love you. God loves me freely. So I'm going to love you freely. It's free. It's free. This is how much God How great God is is that he he died for us not knowing or knowing I should say he died for us knowing that we could reject him. He died for us knowing that we could turn we could say no, we could reject his offer of salvation, but he still was willing to do it. What a great God. What a savior Oh What A Savior? Oh, what a Lord. Oh what a God. I'm sure glad he's my God. How about you you glad he's your God tell somebody's my God. I know so awkward, but it's fun gives me a chance to figure out what I'm going to say next. He will make all things beautiful in his time. The next thing that happens when you trust him is in Luke chapter 18 in Luke chapter 18 and want to read this scripture to You Luke chapter 18 and the width this this persistent Widow get into that and we'll get i'll Circle back to that but in Luke chapter 18 verse 8 Luke chapter 18 verse 8 listen to what the unrighteous judge says, so this woman comes to this unrighteous judge. Says give me legal protection deliver me avenge me and verse will go back to verse 7. He says listen, he said ship. Go to verse 6. then the Lord said hear what the unjust judge said What did he say? He said man this woman is going to keep beating on my door. This woman is going to keep bothering me. I'm going to go ahead and give it to give her the protection. She's asking for I'm going to avenge her not because I'm good, but because she is going to wear me out. And listen to what Jesus says listen to what the unjust judge said and shall not God shall not look if an unjust judge of venture. He says shall not God avenge his own children who cry to him day and night though. He Bears long with them. Look at verse a I tell you. You that he will avenge them speedily he will avenge them speedily. He will avenge them speedily now. Let me tell you what this word speedily means. It doesn't mean fast in a sequence of events. It means that when it happens when he does avenge you it will happen so quick it will happen so fast, it will take place so quickly so swiftly that it will shock you it will Amaze you it will blow your mind. He says, That's what he means by the word speedily he doesn't mean it's good. It's you know in them in the amount of time that it takes. He just means it'll happen speedily that it will happen so fast and it will progress so rapidly once it happens it will it will do it will happen. So rapidly that it will make you forget all the time you waited. All the pain you went through. All the torture it might have felt like all the days you cried out all the months. It's like when a woman gives birth to a child. She goes through Labor. She goes through the all the awkwardness all the uncomfortableness all the changing of her body and her body expanding to give room for that child and her body sometimes getting sick and her body going through all these changes that she's never experienced before that us as men have never experienced period Could we would kill ourselves if we had to go through that? kind of teasing but but when yeah, I'm trying but when that baby is born she forgets. All of her pain she forgets all of her pain. Until you're too. And then your worse. She's like you take him. He will avenge you he will avenge you. He will avenge you. say he will avenge me this if this unrighteous judge Would answer how much more your heavenly father? Your heavenly father and he said when the son of man returns, will he find Faith the end of that verse in verse 8 when the son of man returns, will he find faith on the earth? You see God's all God's expecting of us is to trust him. Trust him what he's looking for his trust trust. Trust him. We take care of the trusting he takes care of the the timing. We take care of the trusting he takes care of the we take care of the trusting. Come on. Everybody. Say we take care of the he takes care of the See I said it seven times now and you finally getting it. It's okay. We need to learn we learn by repetition. We take care of the trusting. He'll take care of the timing and what are we trusting his faithfulness? That's easy. We stop trusting in ourselves the very next verse says and he spoke this Parable to some who trusted in themselves. The problem is trusting in yourself. That's when you get that's when it doesn't work. It works when you trusting in Him. God is Not faithful to us because of our faithfulness God is faithful to us because of his faithfulness. Wow shocking but it's the truth. God is not good to us because we're good. He's good to us because he's good. God doesn't come through for us. because we endured God comes through for us because he endured Because Jesus endured because of what Jesus did well you start realizing this and it becomes easy to trust it's the easiest thing in the world. We're created to trust we're created to depend. When we're infants, we have to depend we don't we don't even think about it. We just naturally depend on our parents parents are going to pick us up. A parents are going to feed us our parents are going to close us. Our parents are going to that's why when a child is abused. It's so devastating because it breaks their natural ability to trust and it damages the trust Factor inside of them. That should have come naturally through the Loving Hands of their parents, but when there's abuse attached to that, Then that child has to repaint be re parented by God and the process in case you're wondering why your why your you know why it's hard sometimes to trust because sometimes the people that you trusted the people that you were created to trust let you down. But now you have to learn to trust a God Who Will Never Let You Down you see So when we take care of the trusting, he'll make all things beautiful in his time. He will avenge us speedily doesn't mean soon. It means when it happens. It will happen in Rapid accelerated fashion. Hang in there because let me tell you something. It will happen trust the goodness of God and he will come through for you the third thing that will happen when you trust him is in Joel chapter 2 verse 25 Joel Chapter 2 verse 25 and he says so I will restore the years. I will restore the years. The next thing that God is going to do in our lives as we trust him is he's going to restore these are the things he does because we trust him. These are the things God promised he would do it's not going to take forever. It's not going to you're not going to have to wait forever. He's going to restore. What is he going to do? He's going to make all things beautiful in his time. You're not gonna have to wait forever. He's going to avenge you speedily he's going Restore to you the years the years. So listen, I'm telling you. There are years of Our Lives that we've all lost years that we lost because of ignorance years that we lost because of bad choices years that we lost because of what somebody did to us years that we lost because of something we did to somebody else years that we lost because of the Devil is a comes to steal kill and destroy the years that we lost. It doesn't matter whose fault it is what matters is God is going to restore the years that have been lost and you don't have to worry about All the time because God can make up for it in one moment. All the years that have been lost. He said I will restore to you the years somebody's got to say men today because somebody's going to get some years added to them. He's going to add years to your life. He's going to restore the Lost Years is going to restore what's been broken. He's going to store restore what's been taken. He's going to restore what's been lost. The Lost opportunities he will restore the lost time he will restore the Lost. Ideas Hill restore the Lost families Hill restore. Well, we He restored a lost coin to a woman who lost her coin He restored a lost sheep to a man who lost his sheep and He restored a lost son to a man who lost his son. He's the restorer he will restore. What's the common theme of all those three things that were restored the coin the sheep and the son Was that was that God did it was that? God restored God restores God restores God is the restorer of all the years. So I go to bed at night and I don't think about all the years that I lost. I start counting up all the years that are going to be added. I don't. fret about all the mistakes I made I think about how he's going to turn them all around. I don't go to bed and worry about what I don't have. I go to bed knowing he's going to avenge me. He's going to restore me. He's going to come through for me because this is who he is and our fundamental problem in life is a misunderstanding of who God is our fundamental problem in any area of our life is our wrong concept of God because once you really understand what he really is like, You'll never worried another day in your life. He'll make all things beautiful in his time so I can relax and Trust he will avenge me so I can relax and Trust he will restore the years so I can relax and trust and he will bring me the Harvest. So I can relax and Trust. Hey Galatians. 6:9 says don't grow weary in doing good for induce in what he's talking about doing good. He's talking about planting good seeds. He's not talking about being a do-gooder better to do good than to do bad. But he's the good that he's talking about is planting seeds. Don't grow weary in doing good for in due season. You will reap if you don't faint if you don't if you don't quit he's not saying if you don't ever You know struggle he's saying don't lose heart at planting don't give up on your planting because wherever you plan to you're going to reap whatever you sow you're going to reap don't give up on your planting. Don't lose heart when it comes to planting because God is Not mocked. Whatever a man sows. He shall also reap that's not written to us in a negative tone. It's written doesn't a positive tone don't God is Not mocked. No one's going to be able to make fun of your God when you keep Implanting the right seeds no one's going to be able to make fun of your God. He's not going to be able to be mocked because let me tell you something you're going to reap if you don't grow weary at planting good seeds so many Christians they give up planting they say their single. God will do it all so I'm just gonna see her but we got to plant seeds. You want to predict your future plant. You want some corn get some corn seed Plant the seed and you'll get yourself some corn. So God is going to give you a harvest. He's going to give you a harvest. He's going to make all things beautiful in his time. He's going to avenge you speedily he's going to restore the years and he's going to bring you a harvest. You know, what else he's going to do. He's going to turn it around. He's going to turn your situation around watch this Esther chapter 9 turned to Aunt Esther chapter 9. You'll fish out fool. Fred Fred G Sanford Esther chapter 9 verse 1 now in the 12th month that is the month of Adar. We in the twelfth month while the 12-month is like the end of the year. Wow. God's going to turn it around. On the 13th day. The time came whoo. Your time is coming the time came now. It says the King's Command. His decree was going to be executed and on the very day. See God may not be early, but he's never late. And on the very day. That on the very day that the enemies of the Jews had helped to overpower them the opposite occurred and the Jews themselves overpowered those who hated them. Look at what the King James Bible says in the King James version. It says in on the 12th month the 13th day. It says when the King's Command has decreed Drew near to put in execution. Look at what it says. In the day the enemies of the Jews hope to have power over them. It was turned to the contrary. Well, what a word it was turned to the contrary who's ready to see your situation turned to the contrary God's going to turn it to the contrary God's going to turn it around you had a bad year God's going to turn it around you had a bad life God's going to turn it around you had a bad marriage God's going to turn it around. You have bad Health God's going to turn it around got bad money God's going to turn around. You got bad attitude guys going to turn it around. Well, you should take care of that attitude part. So what do we do in the meantime? We need to have some perspective. We need to step back and we need to look at things differently. Like now that I know he's going to restore the years. I don't have to be in a hurry now that I know he's going to avenge me. I don't have to worry now that I know he's going to make all things beautiful in his time. I don't have to Scurry. There's nothing I got to do except have the different perspective. I got to look at it differently. Like I'm not having to measure things by my timetable now, I trust God's timing. Perspective perspective perspective to give you an example of a perspective having the right perspective in during World War II General Creighton Abrams and his men were surrounded by their enemy General Creighton Abrams and his men were surrounded by the enemy Generations looked at his men declared with total confidence. They've got us surrounded again the poor bastards. Hey Ethel, did he just cost know I quoted General Abrams. He's feeling sorry for the enemy. They're surrounded by the enemy and he's like I feel sorry for them. You know, why because now we get to attack them from any direction. And we won. And we won. Because of perspective perspective perspective we got to look at this thing differently. We've got to stop looking at it like we're behind and realize God's on time. Stop looking at it. Like we're going to run out and realize we're going to run over God's going to run us over with his Blessing. We got to have perspective. We got to have some patience patience is just sitting there and waiting patients means taking time to consider the facts before reacting. Consider all the facts before reacting. Yeah, the doctor said you got six months live, but let's consider the other fact that were healed by his stripes. We have to have perspective we have to have patience and third we have to have persistence and let me tell you something about persistence persistence is not about us just being strong in our character persistence means the reason we don't take no for an answer is because God already said yes. The reason we don't take no for an answer because God already said yes. So our persistence is not like our moral character. Our persistence is trusting in his character. He already said yes. So the reason I'm not going to take no for an answer is because God already gave an answer and the answer is yes, and amen. Let's Stand Together. What do you do in the meantime have some perspective look at it differently have some patience consider all the facts and the promises of God. And have some persistence the reason I'm not taking no for an answer Lord is because you already said yes. Not because I'm stubborn not because I got such strong character is because he already said yes. I want you to say that he already said yes. He already said yes. He already said yes, and that's why I'm not taking no for an answer. Hey everyone. Hope you enjoyed today's message.

I told you last long the last episode that I'm flying solo for the next two episodes and I hope that you don't mind that one that so with next on the next episode of the episode of 78. We're going to have Korea and Tim back and we're gonna have some guests lined up over the next couple. Weeks as well. So this one can't give you a heads up about everything but I just want to thank you so much for your support and your love and your listen your viewership arses that you listenership whatever you want to call it. But I just want to thank you so much today. I'm kind of want to get into a little thing. That's kind of been something that has happened recently. I had some stuff like we we talked about a couple weeks ago. I think last week we were talking about some of the stuff I post on social media. I do a lot of social media Mia I'm actually a marketing director for a company I work for as well. And so I do a lot on social media. So I see a lot and so I kind of want to talk about this one thing with the hurricane with you know anything from the East Coast. If you're not from the east coast of the US that's quite a fine. You probably heard about the hurricane Dorian that came up the East Coast. Everybody was a category 5 and course it was supposed to be making straight landfall around right in the middle of Central Florida and all kinds of craziness and and You know, what's so funny is they didn't stalling out and then hit it ends before he got to the coast it just hit right up north and when Trout the coastline all the way up to I think the trying right now present Canada, but there was something that came out that seeing a lot of the parts of the by posting out and I read what the picture says so you can understand this is what causes a category 5 hurricane hitting quickly and straight to the Florida Peninsula to pause just before hitting weakening then making making the makes a 7. E5 90-degree turn northward prayer and spiritual warfare and what's interesting about that? The one thing that kind of really gets me about that and I apologize for making some noise in the background when it gets me about that portion of it. Is that Yes, it was actually the parts of the time it was hitting towards Florida and it didn't stuff had changed. But what happened was they were Thomas Muller they're rejoicing like hey, yo, we basically stop a hurricane from hitting the us and one day they fail to realize is that hurricane hit our countries and killed we all know yet. But in the Bahamas made it just totally destroy the, you know, enjoy that country the shreds. Me and that's when the biggest things that we apparently kind of missed when we post this on from like that and the way we act and then I have to I have to be totally honest with you. It's something that I would have, you know, I've dealt with in my life, you know down in the past, you know, thinking like that. Hey we stop this listen to us, you know. Hey the tornado missed my house over the storm hit my house, but don't realize no one. As the houses of the hit in the lives are short because I mean we're talking they were talking about, you know, we made a storm stall and then turn yes, but when it started it wreak more Havoc Bahamas, I mean, they're still trying to find by account trying to count them count the bodies. I mean we're talking about people's lives and people die, but then people's lives or shorts during the house is taking, you know hurt, you know, the livelihood what they do is when taken away from them and they're hurting and And think like some of this would become very insensitive to that and it kind of reminds me of is in the thinking is that we act like that we prayed it as and hit us but we don't do is think about my name room and it was something mean created was talking about, you know, we were traveling this week. So we were kind of discussing talk about a little bit is You know our words do have power but you know, so funny is that we use our words to for ourselves selfish. Very selfishness. Be real. We're very very selfish people human beings were selfish. And the thing is that we know that our words me very powerful but whatever use a words not for ourselves, but for another for instance like we pray like, oh for the tornado not to hit us but yet then it skips off. So we're like, yeah rejoicing my guys great, but then it destroys your neighbor's house. And it is it didn't stop and think about this for a moment. Wait that looks to people who are from the outside looking at this who own who are on the outside looking at something like that. This is it really glorifying God. Is it really the answer is no, it's not actually making him look pretty bad. It's somehow he he will if you pray he will make sure this hit your house, but if you don't pray, he'll hit your house. What kind of guy is that? What kind of father is that? I mean stop and really think about that for a moment and again as a dad, like if you're a parent would you do that to when your children would you because when your children prayed you will make sure that nothing happens to him because I don't want you just going to let everything happen to him. What kind of parent would you be? In this view honestly as a he said bad father, you know, you human fathers we do that how much more does he do that or wouldn't do that? I should say. And they stop and think about that for a moment late. It doesn't go if I have one that just that post just have a stuff that we do. Just makes us look bad. It makes it look very insensitive. Very very very insisted makes it look very selfish. And that's the news horse. I saw the answer is that we didn't have enough faith. People Bahamas that have no faith didn't pray enough and my things and some people use have their devil worshippers. I'm like, wow, they're human beings. And in his love is not defined by how much you pray or how much Faith you have is the fact that you're you and he loves you and that's it. It's not about how much Faith you have or how many prayers over how much prayer time you have had determines anything from him secondly loves you. He gives not based on you but who he is he does stuff for you not based on you but He is and my snapping understand that. But you know so funny though in all of us. Y'all want to talk about spiritual warfare when I'm seeing for what's the relief that's come in to the Bahamas these cruise ships full of supplies of doctors. Stationed themselves on the longer coaster Bahamas bringing stuff in taking people off dialysis. They can have a place to put sleep at night cooking hot meals for people these planes like Tyler Perry Lee Perry, you know flying his private jet flying supplies for the people. That's if you want to call it spirit that spiritual warfare. That's that's my dad. So if you want to say any that's him, you won't say anything spiritual warfare. that's that is what's happening right now as we speak and you might use a new what hey. What can I do Google it? Shoot man, you just give to local your recall so you can help you they can help you. You know me like stop and really think about me and like which one really shows him. I was praying for the storm got to hit us, but it's okay. They fit his others and it does and it's okay and we glorify God like that or yeah, it hit others. So we jump in And when they're beside them through what do their hearts and helping them to heal which one go if I is got more and then we stop and really think about that. It really starts to really use start to really know him and understand him and I stand a lot of stuff is not from him. Let's be real and I'm hoping to us as a body as people as human beings we start to understand this because this is huge. Because how we treat each other's important how we see each other is important how we did talk to each other is important how we listen to what matters important all of its important and dad knows that and I think how we can begin to see him. Is that how we begin to see each other and understand that we don't know everything. But one day we should start now - Noah ham and that's important for us because that's not him. Wow. He didn't make its tolerance how people and kill people and kill people on island people and my thing is would you do that to your own children. I'ma keep these two kids, but I'm going to murder these two kids. No, good parent says that. How much more? Is he then if you're good parents, don't do that. And once you start to really realize that and start walking this out because man, I mean, I stretched it out in the previous episode that we had and I talked about the answer. This is crucial man. This is a crucial time and because it's like us being doctors and we had a roomful of hurting people and we just sit there and we do nothing but put them down from hurting. when we can get we have the ability to heal them with love, but we choose not to That's what we're at right now deeply ideally mean like when I see stuff like this because some people's argument was in that when they posted that was, you know, we experts agree that the you know bombing the nuclear bomb on Japan was the right thing to do because it saves more it's a more lives. So it's okay to just worry about other people. That's so makes it right. I think both were wrong personally. Taking a life is wrong. So human being and seeing them such changes how you didn't treat them massage. In those people I feel for you man. Some horror stories that give you if you have heard man's terrible man to even come up the East Coast this storm hurricane hear about some of these people father watching his son be dragged away from watching a wife looser her husband wants in the husband lose his wife. It hurts if you want students to that spiritual warfare that you turned away from Florida, but yet and then killed a bunch of people heard once other people. I don't call a spiritual warfare one minute. I call that. stupid religious nonsense in all it's doing is making not making people see him and you know him but more or less get them to see you exposing your own self and your flaws to them. And frankly, it makes them want nothing to do with him. Isn't that the point though? You were trying to make a we were trying to make a point with that it's so they get to see him but then we're already doing is driving a wedge between that from them seeing him. I know why we do it. Because I have been in a row. Hurt afraid afraid of your own something you hurt and celebrate the fact that you're still alive that you were spared, but not knowing that. You're there, but you need to go help others and know that ye might spiritual but it didn't spare the other person beside you. and that Then you have compassion for them to go in and help there's that. And I know this this is craziness. I'm gonna keep it short sweet because I can keep going on my just want you to know that he loves you. He wouldn't do that to you. And I post is totally wrong. I hope if you that if you're been affected by that. I just want to know you love. And that he cares about you just as much as he cares about the person next to you and he will never do that to you.

Thank you, Ryan. Thank you for inviting me. Absolutely man. I\\'ve been wanting to get I was telling my earlier class. I\\'ve been trying to get you to teach forever. And so now my strategy is to is to try to teach you how to create your own Academy, you know, because this knowledge that you have like has to get out. I think it\\'s you know, it\\'s really weird that it\\'s not because II mean, I don\\'t know if you remember I sent you a message because I saw your email about the creating a webinar. Yeah, and I\\'ve gotten to a point in my career now where I don\\'t know. I mean you\\'re probably aware of it, but I\\'m not freelancing for anybody anymore. Hmm. I decided to retire from that last June. Yep, and I\\'ve been wrapping up projects and everything. I\\'m still finishing some stuff, but I mainly like free to just focus on my own product like this character that you see on screen. That\\'s part of my next. And but I feel that it would be a lot more full feeling to actually share, you know, whatever little knowledge. I\\'ve acquired like I don\\'t know 20-something years doing this and honestly, I\\'m thinking I\\'m thinking I want to do that. You know, I think it\\'s it\\'s a good thing. I\\'m not saying like full-time or anything but on a more regular basis, which I\\'ve I haven\\'t really ever done that so yeah, so why don\\'t we start with a bit of an introduction like what do you do? Today like what\\'s the primary thing you do that, you know pays the bills. Okay. Well here well, first of all, I started I started doing this like sculpting when I was like, I don\\'t know like for whatever but before I get into what I do nowadays and when I was in high school my high school teacher got me into Mattel toys and that changed everything for me. Well when you\\'re in high school, yeah, I was in high school I was I was I was like 16 at the time I think is my junior or senior year something like I can\\'t remember I\\'m old now and and it was fun. It was amazing. Just just going into this government type facility where you know, they have like to scan like your badges and everything. You have to go through like two or three security doors and everything. It was amazing and then like I it was like being at Willy Wonka\\'s and I like the doors would open and you see like people play with toys. And I people deciding and a bunch of cubicles a bunch of toys. Yeah, it\\'s amazing. I love that face and to this day. I still help them out with with projects and stuff. But mainly I\\'ve stopped doing freelancing for for most of my clients as last year and and I\\'ve been focusing on on my company prototype studios though. The whole idea behind prototype Studios is just too Create product that the truly kind of comes close to what people see in terms of like, you know our ads or like the images that we show the product. So like you know that we\\'re trying to basically create product that comes really close to the Prototype and that\\'s very tough. But but it\\'s possible to create something that looks exactly well not exactly but really close to what What you see on screen when people are like shopping for our product. You won\\'t be let down that\\'s what I\\'m trying to say. So yeah, so that took a lot of effort and work and everything and QC and and a lot of stuff in China. But um, but it\\'s paying off and right now we just released our second character and in our street fighter line Akuma, and yeah, the reviews are great. So so that\\'s what I do. Now. I\\'ve been doing freelance for like I think 15 years 16 years. I\\'ve been in the industry since 93. So it\\'s been almost 24 years or so. And yeah, and now like I\\'m just looking forward to being able to do not just like earn a living by creating our product but giving back to the community. I just signed up for the Los Angeles Public Library System contacted me and yeah, they wanted to like travel over the city and throughout the state and maybe even the country teaching like half an hour like Classes like you know really compact really, you know aim that at children and the youth yeah, you know about like, you know, my career what I did all these years and what it is that you know, they can do in the future what it is that they can expect and it just answering questions showing like little demos and stuff. But yeah, it\\'s that\\'s what I\\'m looking forward to doing more in the so what would you say your job is your job title digital sculptor toy sculptor. How\\'s that work? I don\\'t know that because I\\'ve been a tradition. Sculptor since like 93 and well actually professionally. Yeah, but I\\'ve been sculpting with Clay my whole life and my approach to 3D is like it\\'s extremely basic and very I don\\'t know just just course, you know, I I just use like the claybuildup brush the clay brush trim Dynamic standard. And I don\\'t know pinch the union standard and that\\'s it. That\\'s all I use. So I\\'m not really technical when it comes to the software. That\\'s all you need. It\\'s all you need. So when you\\'re talking to these kids, do you say like you\\'re a sculptor? Like if somebody\\'s looking at the job that they would do so people like, you know, I\\'m a toy designer. I\\'m a sculptor A lot of people go like, oh, what is that? And they wanted me to keep doing some some more stuff, but I just decided that it\\'s probably for the best for me to move on and into this New Path. And yeah, that\\'s what I\\'m I They were part of the announcement that you\\'re retiring from freelance. You\\'re going to work with them full-time. Remember a yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so now is it fair to say that you\\'re starting your own company focusing on IP basically developing IP, actually. Yeah that that\\'s actually correct. I\\'m actually working on a line right now that is like completely original and I\\'m exploring the possibility of getting into toys as well. Just original stuff. Is that the issue? In our industry right now is like completely completely overpopulated with similar product. Yeah, and getting licenses has become like really tough because when you\\'re about to like get a license, there\\'s already like Q or a line of like 10 companies that want to get the same license. So even if you\\'re able to get it, there\\'s going to be like a lot of competition for basically the same type of license the same type of character some product and you know, So that\\'s that\\'s become really tough for the Collectibles industry, but I do believe there\\'s a market there but you\\'re like people can see like original Ip. So that\\'s awesome. So what do you tell people when they say they want to be a toy designer? You know? Well, I think it\\'s a cool thing because like, you know, the toy industry and the Collectibles industry are like basically they\\'re part of the same family in a sense, but the Collectibles Industries like really tiny. Brother to the toy industry the toiletries a lot bigger, but if people want to become like for example when they asked me to go I want to become a threat to Center. Yeah, that\\'s feasible. That\\'s great. Pay is great. Obviously depending on who you\\'re working for. But but the Collectibles industry is a lot tinier there is work out there but not the same as before because there\\'s just like there\\'s just like too many companies doing a lot of stuff so that kind of tends to to bite back in a sense where whereas you used to like, you know work with one or two clients a year in order to survive. Now, you have to probably like well people nowadays have to like probably have like, you know, try to get like ten clients so that they can get less work for me but enough in volume to survive which is, you know, a little bit tougher tougher in them. So garnet and is Side Show an example of a company working in collectibles. Yes, I choose like the king of Collectibles the stuff that they do. It\\'s not just a company that really seems to understand and grasp what it is that people like and and that sense. They come to a point where they\\'re on top. They\\'re they\\'re they\\'re the King of the Hill from my perspective and you know the product they always keep pushing themselves and the product that they\\'re putting out is like just amazing the the signs and everything. It\\'s just great. It seems to be like they kind of mix the system that you use and in a large like special effects Studio or a movie like, you know Film Studio whatever and they got into the coal Collectibles, you know Arena and they came up with a really awesome system where you know where you see like how they go about like creating the concept and everything brainstorming and everything. It\\'s just amazing. It\\'s pretty similar to like what happens in You know film studios, so it\\'s a pretty cool thing. Hmm. So how does somebody get started? What do they need to learn to get into this? Well, one thing that you need to learn more than anything is like I think it\\'s you need to know exactly what makes you happy for some people it could be like just you know trying to do like, you know more abstract designer toys for other people. It might be something like working for a company such as like, I don\\'t know Sideshow or me. Arlen where they require things to be like a little bit more realistic. So in that sense, you need to learn more human anatomy take life drawing classes. I don\\'t know if you agree with this, but I have this point of view that or I believe that if someone wants to get really good at sculpting they need to be really good at drawing then again their sculptures that are great at what they do, but they can\\'t really draw that well, but I think it does work the other our way around whereas, you know, someone can be a great sculptor but not really draw a really well. It\\'s really funny that if if you\\'re really good at drawing into the you can get really good at sculpting. So I\\'ve seen people like Ray Bill laughing whoo, the sculptor that used to be in the industry in the colliculus industry and he was a kindergarten teacher and he would draw like amazing like in a really cool drawings and one day he picked up Clay and he was a pro like overnight serious. No job and I do believe there\\'s a connection there. So yeah, you know, I have a I have this belief that sculpture is the first art and you know, because it\\'s like it\\'s 3D so it\\'s in the you\\'re basically replicating something that is in the same form, right and then painting and drawing our artificial their artifice. You have to interpret. Yeah. I see what sculpting it\\'s more tangible and you can keep you can do that and And into the as well where you can actually keep like refining but it\\'s more tactile. It\\'s more. I don\\'t know just more natural. I guess that sense. Yeah, so if we\\'re talking about, you know, sculpting and Anatomy, this is actually a conversation you and I had a while ago because you you dive deep into Anatomy some time ago with Ray Bustos, if I remember right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and so one of the problems I have myself and with my students has an Me is you know, you say hey go learn some anatomy and it\\'s like welcome to the next five years of your life. Well, where\\'s like one year disappeared and I well I sculpt better and I know Anatomy but you know, like where\\'s the cutoff point, you know, because the other thing that\\'s important here just to kind of keep going and I notice is specifically in yeah specifically in toy sculpting is you know, there\\'s we\\'re not really focused on realism, you know. Like Michelangelo would there\\'s a there\\'s a an impact that somebody\\'s trying to make so the deltoid, you know is not going to be necessarily like say Richard McDonald deltoid. It\\'s going to have some volume and pump because they\\'re going for a style. So how do you manage the style of things with the realistic anatomy of stuff? And where\\'s the cut off so that somebody doesn\\'t just spend a year of their life, you know going down that that black hole. Well, I think I think it is very important to learn the Six of structure and atomy I don\\'t necessarily believe that you need to be an anatomist and and know every single tendon in the human body and right. I don\\'t know like, you know artery and everything and nerves everything but it does help to know. I mean if you look at Steve Lord what he can do the man is amazing. He can do anything. Yeah. He\\'s a gift to sculpting first time. Yeah, exactly. But I do believe I can never tell with my anatomy of You study my anatomy. I mean anyone that really knows about Anatomy will know that a lot of my stuff is completely exaggerated granted. That\\'s given me in a sense. That\\'s that\\'s kind of set me apart from a lot of people and yeah, you can say that. Well, yeah, but you know, your Anatomy is like wonky here. It is true II, I do believe that\\'s the way it is and that\\'s that\\'s my purpose to create something. That\\'s more of my artistic interpretation of say a bicep. You know apps or whatever, you know, Victoria muscles. It\\'s just I I mix what I see in anime. I mix what I see and comic books American comic books and just like, you know art all around me and and and there\\'s these guys like the Shiflett brothers and they tend to make these characters that look so real but at the same time like it\\'s just fantasy anatomy and it\\'s just it just works. It is mind-blowing. Yeah and A good example of that in terms of 2D is Simon Bisley. If you look at the the art assignment visually, you can tell that the man knows his Anatomy but he adds muscles that are not there that don\\'t exist. But he just makes my heart all the better and that\\'s the approach I have to it and all of you will go like Eric. This muscle right here doesn\\'t exist on my God. No, I just I just thought it looked cool. And that\\'s it. That\\'s my Approach To be honest. And I think you can be a great sculptor and know Anatomy really well, but I\\'ve seen some sculptors that can do really really cool things. But it all seems to look like like just the same as their last piece and it\\'s just like the flow the of the anatomy of the Everything is like it\\'s a little static, you know, and and and and I think like, you know, you can play with it. You can just you just like, you know been things like I\\'m really well-known for for example doing things like like I don\\'t know if it\\'s here or not, but I don\\'t know what this Magneto we can see it, but I\\'ll probably like grab like, you know the legs at this point and then just use the move brush and just like basically curve them a little bit just just ever so slightly. Lightly and by doing that it just creates this this flow to the whole piece. The silhouette looks a lot cooler and more Dynamic and people seem to be attracted to that. And that\\'s worth for me. I\\'m not saying that that\\'s the best way to do it. I\\'m not saying that it is correct. I\\'m just saying that I like it personally and you know, it seems that there\\'s people out there that like it so yeah. All right, but but now I have to bring this up right because Where is well? Let me just say this way and and I\\'m not trying to be derogatory cuz I\\'m kind of a fan of his work. I have a couple of this covers up on my up on my wall. But at what point does this become Rob liefeld where? Oh, yeah. Well, I think it\\'s you have to kind of Have control at a certain point, you know, when we talking like, you know Comics or whatever you can only go so far. You cannot go to insane. I cannot just like grab this guy and say, okay, I\\'m Gonna Make You know the pecs like, you know pop out. You know a lot more, you know, and boom I got you know that obviously people are not going to like that. You know, it\\'s just completely deformed and it looks like wonky but I mean within the parameters of realism you can I believe that there\\'s leeway for you to play one thing that a lot of artists do is that because you know, I get I\\'m pretty sure you get those messages constantly as well emails or private messages. They tell me like, oh, you know my family. My mom says that I\\'m a Artist or a my uncle says he\\'s you know that I\\'m a great artist that I\\'m going to make a big and then I see the work and you can tell that the person you know needs a little bit more practice, but then I\\'ve seen a lot of these people that keep listening to like you no friends or relatives or whatever, you know, you have to understand that these people love you and they don\\'t want to hurt you and for the most part they are probably not artists and they\\'ll say like, oh that looks cool to me, you know, and and that\\'s good good at all. But if you don\\'t Don\\'t become your worst critic. You will never grow I think that\\'s the worst issue that us artists have like if we think like we reached the Pinnacle. That\\'s when you stop growing. That\\'s when you stop like learning and and a lot of people like will message me or post like when I\\'m whenever I post something, you know on Facebook or something, they\\'ll go like oh, thank you master and that really I mean does it upset me? But it just makes me feel uncomfortable because I I know in my mind deep inside. Me that I\\'m still learning. I mean if you look at my work say that just a year ago or six months ago or two years ago. You can tell that I\\'ve learned more and more and I keep refining like crap and I just don\\'t feel I\\'m at that level and I think I\\'m gonna be 80 and I\\'m still not gonna be happy with what I\\'m doing. I mean you can say like I\\'m enjoying this but I\\'m not going to say like, oh, wow, this is the best. I am the best. I don\\'t think it works in that sense. And and if you think that way You will just like stopped progressing and I think art is about you know, the stuttering learning, you know, and that\\'s what makes it fun. It\\'s a journey it\\'s a journey that to me. I don\\'t think it will ever end. I just don\\'t think so. I don\\'t think I\\'m gonna be like a hundred and say okay. That\\'s it. I\\'m done. I learned everything I needed to learn about sculpting. I just don\\'t think so. So, you know, I think my best advice would be to check yourself and and and keep searching for yeah, I don\\'t know like for that point where you feel that you\\'ve grown but but never get to a point where you think okay. That\\'s it. I know everything because that\\'s bad career for you. It\\'s just not cool. Yeah, you know and I think this is one of the things that\\'s really attracted me to this conversation with you is you know, like in the process of me trying to get you to teach I always ran up against this wall. We were like, I\\'m not I don\\'t feel like I\\'m a master. I don\\'t feel like I\\'m ready and Don\\'t feel like I\\'m there to teach and I\\'m thinking like in the back of my mind. I don\\'t know if I ever said it directly but I\\'m thinking like that\\'s why you have to teach right? It\\'s because it\\'s because people have to see that so I\\'m glad we have this conversation. So so people can understand this but I want to dive a little deeper into this because for me in my experience this has been this conversation has been one of the primary conversations I\\'ve had with myself which is, you know, I don\\'t have into Anatomy thinking that one side of into Me I would be ready to go out there and create something but what happened was is I dove into the anatomy and that made the walls bigger and you know, I saw everything that was really had to be done. And then I saw the people that actually really did it well and I was like, you know, and so all I thought my I would be able to achieve but all I did is I raised my expectations. I see what you\\'re saying. You know that just like that\\'s that, you know, put some serious walls up. But what I notice about people like yourself and and some of the other sculptors like Steve Lord that you know are really going out there and creating on a daily basis is is you don\\'t have those walls or if you have those walls. It\\'s like you\\'re jumping those walls all the time. You\\'re still creating you you don\\'t worry about what you don\\'t have you just go. Yeah, actually I was going to say that it\\'s not really there\\'s no secret. It\\'s just like you just go and it\\'s not just In a sense, it\\'s not just about creating art and just just going and jumping these walls. It\\'s like you also have other things that are other issues that you have to worry about like for someone in my case. I have four kids. I have a wife. I have a mortgage as you know, and and I have to make the best of it. I can\\'t afford to just stay stagnant and not do anything not practice not like I mean I have to be honest. I haven\\'t drawn and a long time but I\\'m always sculpting every single day and I believe When I actually pick up a piece of paper my drawing is a lot better and I that\\'s all I can tell like oh, okay, so I\\'m getting better. That means that you know, I\\'m doing something right. But yeah, I just sometimes you just can\\'t afford to stop for many reasons aside from just doing what you love but I think that\\'s a good thing. I think it\\'s a great thing. And so it pushes you to push your boundaries and you know, sometimes you do it right sometimes, you know, you learn and you go Like okay next time the project that I make or the next Magneto I make it will be a lot better. I can see the issues with the one I just did like six months ago. Yeah, and I\\'ll try to you know do something better next time around. Yeah, I\\'d love to dive into that a little more if I can because like that. I see it in students. They have the luxury of stopping to learn and then you get into the library in your library mode and you know Librarians don\\'t go out there and fight the daily battles, right? So but when you\\'re out there in the arena and you have to You know what the strategies that Survivor the strategies that win. So what strategies like, how do you get into that mindset where you just keep going? And you don\\'t stop because you\\'re learning but you\\'re also still going so you know, what what kind of strategies what kind of mental like, how do you play that game? Any so that\\'s actually that\\'s actually a great question man that no one\\'s ever asked me that that\\'s actually great question. I this just me personally. I am a geek at heart. So one thing that I do is that if I\\'m actually resemble I wake up in the morning, you know, like 6:00 in the morning. I you know start getting the kids ready for school take him to school come back. I have a really quick breakfast I go to the gym because now I\\'m working out because I stopped doing that and I recommend that you never stop working out because that\\'s that could also believe it or not that influences your State of Mind totally mere yeah that effect. Art that affects your development and I\\'ve learned that it\\'s important for me to do it. I mean, I\\'m not a I don\\'t live there but you know the gym but I go three times a week. I think that\\'s cool. I rest in between you know days and and I\\'m eating better A lot healthier and I feel a lot better. So when when I\\'m when I come in here like at 10 in the morning and I\\'m ready to start sculpting I try to pick up a comic book or whatever it is that I\\'m going to be doing if I\\'m going to be scoping werewolf. I\\'ll probably watch like, you know, I\\'ll start watching like, you know werewolf movie or anything that\\'s related to the subject that I\\'m sculpting. I listen to a lot of soundtracks believe it or not really epic soundtrack just like get me pumped up and that helps a lot and then mentally I always try to visualize what the character or the piece will look like completely done. I try to visualize what people will think of it when they see it. And I don\\'t just I you know, I think of something like peachy and nice and perfect I think of scenarios that could be negative like oh, well, you know, what about the fur Eric? You know, I\\'m looking at your piece that you did and the fur doesn\\'t look so clean. So I try to make sure that I cover all bases as much as possible take some notes and as I started developing or sculpting the piece and you know, I can start from a dynamesh ball or like a base mesh or whatever. I make sure that what I saw in my mind. I try to go over those notes just to make sure that I\\'m covering all bases and and just going through the motions like that. It gets it actually gets me pumped up. I believe that your mind the state of your mind controls how you feel and basically you have your own little thermostat, you know, and and you can control how you feel. A lot of people say like no I\\'m depressed. I really can\\'t control that. I believe personally, this is just for me, you know, this is just You can control whatever you think you can achieve. So if I feel sad and I keep attracting or thinking of these negative thoughts. It\\'s going to get me in a bad mood and it\\'s not going to help me get the project the project on but if I start thinking like, you know, if I don\\'t feel well and I\\'m having like that thoughts or whatever this morning I start thinking positive things. I\\'d pop in a movie that\\'s positive or whatever upbeat music whatever it starts changing my whole environment from the inside. I\\'d and then that makes me want to give it my best. But if I don\\'t do that, then you know, it\\'s like you know that movie In My Head Starts controlling everything and I\\'m not going to let that happen because if I do that\\'s gonna create issues with with with the project and eventually I meant might end up living under a bridge so I don\\'t want to do that as much as possible. You know what I\\'m say, so totally don\\'t have you ever like, you know, come close and and then that Jumped you into action. So, you know, you know what the what the results are. Yeah. Yeah it I do it all the time. I do it every day. Sometimes I struggle to be honest. It\\'s come to a point where well, I\\'ve come to points in my career where honestly I just don\\'t even want to come into the studio like it\\'s happened. Like I\\'m just so burnt out and that\\'s one of the main reasons why I quit freelancing systematically. I just honestly I was just tired of doing what someone else wanted me to do when I knew that I could probably create my own vision of this or that and and and in the beginning for like the best like I would say like the first maybe 10 years of my career. Honestly. I was just like happy with I was content with sculpting anything. It was like if it was like a hand or a boot or or rock or whatever. It didn\\'t matter to me. I was just like so happy doing that and it\\'s really weird like I started And through this transition where I started feeling like, oh, well, this is cool. But we\\'re going to be cooler if I was doing this or if I sculpted this got Scylla this way, like if I elongated that\\'s not a little bit more if I make made him creepier this way, you know, and I started thinking like OK I have to like create my own. I don\\'t know like like platform where I can actually give people what I like and if people like it and they buy it all the better. And that\\'s what I did with prototypes. That\\'s how I started doing that and and and to be honest. It\\'s it\\'s something that works. Like if you if you control your thoughts, you can control anything. It\\'s like sculpting man. It\\'s the same process. I believe like you control your thoughts you control your actions you control your actions you control, you know situations if you can control that you can control your destiny basically and I believe that it is possible. It\\'s just a matter of Of being aware of your thoughts sometimes like it happens to you. And I man, we\\'re you know, we\\'re tired we wake up we take a shower we\\'re eating like having breakfast and we\\'re reading the cereal box. We\\'re reading the ingredients and that\\'s all we\\'re doing. We\\'re not doing anything else, but what if we control our thoughts and just like when we\\'re focused like sculpting or doing whatever being creative what have we were creative about our thoughts and and start like, you know reinforcing that image in your mind with positive thoughts and then the movie that place in your mind. Becomes positive and then then you go. Like whoa, I can do anything. I can achieve this I can do this and then you start getting ideas about oh, you know what I could open a studio doing this or I could create this the next best toy line or something or action figure line or whatever and then you see that as you start working on that to achieve these things doors open. I\\'ve seen it with you man. I always there with you when you started doing all these things like teaching classes and you are mighty And I will be forever thankful for teaching me that secret surprise that you did and and I saw how you were struggling and trying to get people in and letting people know that you know, this is the next best thing and you need to learn this software. And at first I was adamant I was like no, I really think I need to learn this. I already put in so many years like learning how to work in wax and Clay but you made a Believer out of me and I\\'m pretty sure had you not been so focused and and and so gung-ho about doing this a lot of us probably wouldn\\'t be doing what we\\'re doing and that\\'s that\\'s that\\'s basically evidence that Doing things that way can change not just your life but a lot of people\\'s lives so and that\\'s awesome. Thanks Batman. So what I heard there was that like the key component was the prep for getting into the studio. So, you know, do your exercise eat get yourself moving there and then to kind of modulate the time in studio if you\\'re not getting into it and whatnot, you know just have external elements like but some music on yeah, read some Comics go to the comic book shop and shop for something that for a comic or it doesn\\'t necessarily have to do anything with with the subject that you\\'re trying to sculpt but maybe you\\'ll find the car book that that has like certain, you know line art that looks amazing that you can Implement into your interior work and and that\\'s what I do and I\\'m always looking for these tidbits of information coming from Different peoples like art or interpretation of the character and I\\'m working on or or something similar and that actually enriches my my own art. I think that\\'s a it\\'s impossible for you to just say cuz I heard people say like, oh, well, you know, I just want to create something. That\\'s so original that you know it no one\\'s ever done it before there\\'s this video on YouTube that I recommend people watch. It\\'s called everything so remix and I think it\\'s true. You can just grab like, you know elements from this and this and this Some type of Art and then mix it blend it and then basically give it your own touch and it becomes magically a new thing and and that\\'s what I try to do man. I\\'m not doing anything, you know out of the ordinary. I just basically try to mix elements and things that I like. It\\'s like when you\\'re at the I don\\'t know when you\\'re at the what\\'s called a pizza read this place out here in California and you want to make your own pizza and you have all these elements write all these ingredients and you just go. Ok. I want to live it of this and this and this and this and then you come up with your own pizza. That\\'s that\\'s basically what I think I\\'m doing with my stuff, you know Works some people seem to like it. Some people don\\'t but you know for the most part it\\'s done well for me. So how important is it in your opinion that people be inspired like on a daily basis. Yeah. I think I think that\\'s the cool thing about being an artist is that We have this internal flame, you know and you have to be careful for it not to go out and the way you feed it the way you keep it alive is by by looking and admiring other people\\'s work. I think and just everything around you, you know, and I\\'ve heard some are to say that go. Yeah. No, I just don\\'t look at other peoples work. I just, you know focus on my own stuff and it\\'s really those are the people that I see that don\\'t really grow. Like I said, I think They\\'re important for you, too. You know remain aware that that you know, you need to feed that flame and it could be through a movie Sometimes Ryan. I\\'m I just I just get to a point where I hit a wall and I think it happens to a lot of us where I just feel like oh, yeah. I can\\'t I have sculptors block. I can\\'t forget that scope in your mat. And and I know in my mind I can but I\\'m just like, okay. Maybe this is my brain or my heart or whatever. You want to call it telling me that I need to take a break. And I\\'ll see what I do. Is that I\\'ve learned now that what I have to do is just like, you know, maybe go to the movie movie theater. Sorry go to the movie theater and get inspired by say, I don\\'t know Pacific Rim or whatever sci-fi movie that\\'s playing when I come back man. I\\'m I realized that that flame has been fed. It\\'s burning inside of me. And all I want to do is like get back to my desk and start sculpting and and finessing and adding all these little details that Maybe I might have captured either. You know, I just like really paying a lot of attention to the movie or just like letting myself go and and just trying to bask in the whole amazing. I don\\'t know group of elements that that the movies like throwing at me, you know, whether your dad consciously or not. It is that you\\'re feeding that playing and then when you come back and you bestow that into your work you and view your work with with that kind of Inspiration it you\\'ll see you\\'ll see it works. It just you just feel happy to just be doing what you\\'re doing. But sometimes you just need to push and like I said, I explore every single tool that I have and that could be just like Comics or a book or audiobooks which I listened to those much more than actually reading and sometimes I just go to Art station and I spend hours just looking at the work of these magnificent artist out there and That inspires me so much man. Seriously, it\\'s whenever I feel like like blue or stock or something. I just look at the work of others and that that kind of like brings me back, you know from the abyss. Yeah it do you think there\\'s ever a time where you know or a benefit to just pushing through, you know, when you\\'re when you\\'re lost or you know, you get that sculptors block or is it something you have to recharge? Yeah, you know one thing that I\\'ve noticed and this is again, this is personal. Sometimes I just feel Sad, you know like tears I feel like something\\'s missing. Yeah, I feel this way. It\\'s went out my wife. We went to movies. It was cool or we you know, I know we went out to dinner whatever and everything\\'s cool. But then I realized that that I have probably been neglecting that one piece that I started like maybe two months ago. Hmm, and when I get back to it and start working on it, I might not really be as his fired and when I push through Then I have actually discovered that oh, wow, this this could be a great piece. For example a few months back. Well, basically your last year I was here and and the studio and I was really tired and I had you know, exactly I had basically an ounce that that I was not going to do freelance. So as soon as I did that a lot of companies are saying okay, can you do this and this and this and this before you and it was I got crazy man. It was cool and I\\'m grateful for the work. So anyway, so, um, But at the end of the day like I was like so burnt out, you know, and but I still felt like like this emptiness that I feel like I don\\'t know why I feel like there\\'s something else I need to do and I\\'m like when I\\'m done I\\'ve been working on this thing for like all day and then I just grabbed a dynamesh ball and started sculpting just just just without thinking and I ended up sculpting these things called Chi juvies. I came up with that stuff actually came up with the name my friend William and basically They look really cute. They\\'re like, you know, I did this like King Kong like baby and they look like little balls of like fur something and they\\'re cute and I actually had a couple of companies like interested in buying them, you know the whole line so I\\'m actually about to produce these myself. So and it\\'s exactly Kaiju Teeth movies Yak. I do get the machine. Yeah. The machine is just a basic page and you can see a But seriously, man, I get a bunch of emails from people saying that I want to buy him. I want to buy him and I still have not started producing them, you know, but does that been wrapping up a lot of other stuff but uh, but I hope these things like an oak and eventually sell at Walmart or Target or whatever and I\\'ve been getting quotes from the factories. They tried everything and to be honest like it\\'s feasible. It\\'s possible but that never would have happened had I not stayed that night. I know for a fact that can I not State and push through I never would have seen In the birth of these little guys even even if nothing happens even if nothing comes out of these I know for a fact that people like them a lot and that in itself is just just makes me happy knowing that there\\'s a few people that owe some copies because I made some resin copies and we sold out at the signer called last year where we have a couple see those have sold out, huh? Where did people see those at the signer Kang? Oh, yeah. He said there was a website. Oh, yeah, it\\'s a monster in the machine.com. Nobody\\'s got that URL. No, I think I think actually I don\\'t know that name came about when I was watching this. Anime called The Ghost in the Shell and I was like Ghost in the Shell but about monster in the machine anyway, so they\\'re they\\'re awesome. There was like a band. Yeah that anyway, but they\\'re not around anymore. But yeah, and did you just cute and they have big old black eyes and everything and and people love them man and my kids like them a lot when they saw my God, he\\'s so cute because it can we get a coffee and so I made a bunch of copies for them. They started painting them different colors everything and but yeah again man, if I had not pushed through when I was at my limit, I never would have come up with these things. I know for a fact because the idea came to me as I was just You know, I just grabbed a diner dynamesh ball and started. I inserted a couple of big ol eyes like spheres. Mmm and then adding the eyelids and that\\'s what I know like, oh I can turn this into like a like a baby Godzilla kind of thing and then like into and then that\\'s it. The first one took like three hours and then the rest of like an hour and a half each and that\\'s it. You know, I printed them in my form to Had my friend George cast all of them and I started selling them like they\\'re the size of like golf balls, you know? Yeah, and then I made versus are the size of a softball like a lot bigger. And yeah, man, they sold out. They people keep emailing me and asking me and I feel bad because I have not been able to like answer all those emails. It\\'s a thing, you know, that\\'s also I know I might be sitting on a gold mine and I have no idea. All right a couple of questions for you. Andrews asking do you still work in clay in wax? Actually I am right now I\\'m working on I mean I have not done that in like maybe an over a year I go to Japan like every year for this thing called winter wonder Festival. It\\'s a place where all the sculptors in Japan gather and they sculpt their own original Ip creations and they sell mess kits and and basically I I did this bus and that was the last piece I sculpted like a year ago and play and wax but right now I\\'m sculpting Gamera from you know, licensed Gamera Kaiju. It\\'s a turtle kind of looks like Godzilla and that thing is huge. It\\'s the size of I don\\'t know what scale that is because it\\'s a Kaiju so I don\\'t know. It\\'s like 18 inches tall. I\\'m sculpting that like by hand completely in super Sculpey. Oh nice. Oh, that\\'s that\\'s that\\'s going to be a lot of fun because I\\'m just working on the Armature right now and setting everything up and then I\\'m going to start covering everything and it\\'s super Sculpey that\\'s going to be fun. I\\'m going to be showing that on my Facebook wall. Hmm. Yeah people can see like the videos and pictures and everything because I know a lot of people are always asking like, oh can you sculpt something and clay and show us the steps? So I\\'m going to be doing that so Yeah, that\\'s awesome. Yeah, I don\\'t get to that much to be honest. I just don\\'t anymore. Yeah. Yeah zbrush is kind of two essential at this point. Yeah, it\\'s super essential. I believe that if it wasn\\'t because of zebras, like seriously, I literally would be living under a bridge. So just so you get an idea before having my own horn, but I\\'m a pretty quick traditional sculptor and I used to do maybe like 25 Projects in a year maybe 20 sometimes but I\\'m talking like bigger stuff, you know not tiny things and also counting like, you know accessories and things like that. So but now with what the software I can actually I mean I\\'ve sculpted I think two years ago. I counted like 75 projects, you know, so so yeah, you can do a lot more like one person becomes like an army of like maybe like three guys, you know, yeah, that\\'s great. I love how all of your problems always end up. Under a bridge to so so we always know where to find Eric if the problems get too big. We just gotta find the right bridge but nla is got a lot of them. So yeah, that\\'s true. All right. George is asking it\\'s a bit of a business question. He\\'s asking how much of your sculpting choices are influenced by what you personally like to do versus, you know, finding the popular demand so to speak Well one thing that I do to be honest is that I am very active on social media and like, you know forums and stuff like that. And yeah and I listened to what people want because obviously ultimately what I do is actually a business and you have to give people what they want, you know, and you know, I kind of like basically conform or within those parameters of what people like I just do what I want as well, you know, but But that\\'s basically what I do. I just listen to feedback and obviously you can\\'t listen to everybody because you know, some people say like, oh that Magneto for example like oh, why are you making them floating? You know why like maybe like 80% of people want them like floating so so I cut to listen to the majority of the people so, you know, but there\\'s been occasions where like a guy will say like, oh that Wolverine he should probably at like Maple Leaf, you know because you know, he comes from Canada and that will make the statute look better and I\\'ve done that and then you know, I just don\\'t post it or anything they\\'ll post pictures and then when they actually opened the box they see that they go. Oh, wow, this guy listens so that that I think that in itself actually people people appreciate that a lot. Yeah, that\\'s actually connect with your audience. And that sense. It\\'s pretty cool. All right, man. Well, I have an awesome time chatting. You and thank you so much for kind of diving into process because that\\'s what you know, I really enjoy just your thoughts and on the philosophy of this. So I\\'m glad we got to dive into it. Thank you. Thank you Ryan again. I\\'m not I\\'m not saying this because I\\'m talking to you but I am so thankful for everything that you\\'ve shared with me and throughout the years. Sometimes you\\'ll send me videos and everything and I thank you for that. And I know that you\\'re always like your main concern is to actually spread. The knowledge of these things and a lot of us are super grateful for everything that you do man. Thank you appreciate and thanks and maybe we can we can get you with your own Academy going that would be awesome actually Ryan and you know, I\\'m serious. Yeah, whenever you have time, let me know when we can talk. I really want to do it. I think the one thing like I said that really makes me happy now is like being able to share these things with people. I mean as you know 3D Doesn\\'t have just a few applications. I mean you can actually create stuff that that could save lives like for example, you can actually probably skull, you know, like synthetic years and things like that and we\\'re laying if somehow I can help someone understand that and make the world a better place and that says that would be so cool, man. Yeah if I can help in any way I will hire some yeah. Thanks. Great. Thank you. Thanks guys for your for showing up for being here and all right, Eric. Men have an awesome day. All right, man.

Anyway, and which are real words as before mentioned are. Our brand new Instagram page is doing really good. I guess we're up over a hundred followers. We already had leaked. We already have more followers than Porter doesn't is actually kind of hey, hey stop hitting. I told you guys. I only follow people who are important to me.

Laughs we want to shout out my own blood my own sister Haley Pierce now, I guess you don't know your sister's name. Well, okay. Well, it's different than mine.

Okay also shout-out to Livi christensen's she also shared our post, but she shared it. She's a true homey. Thank you first things first. Is this week? We want to get into just just a little recap of the week. We had some things we did and specifically some life lessons that we've learned. So I'm going to go first yesterday. We got about 5 5 or so inches of snow and me and Dax took the opportunity to do a little bit of sledding, but we learned an important lesson, you know, as fun as a construction site looks to go sledding. It's really just dirt covered in a couple inches of snow. It's not a good idea you like Okay, wait, hold on. I've never looked at a construction site and thought hmm. Maybe I should go sledding there. Yeah tell there's snow on it. Yeah just looks like a hill just imagine like a 50-foot Dirt Pile covered in snow it looking at the bottom. There's a crane with a actually it was like a bulldozer tractor. Yeah, that makes it much I'd much rather hit a bulldozer than a crane. No, that's exactly the lesson. I think we learned is like we were going down the hill, you know, you don't really look first and then you sled right into a pile of cinder blocks, which I actually Really did almost broke my collarbone or then Daxton on the other hand cut like six feet of hair and almost went right underneath the bulldozer. So that would be my recommendation for you guys before you go sledding just make sure there's no construction equipment on site or to just jump over the cinder blocks as you can do that while you're sweating like some of us weren't D1 down. Sorry Daxton competitive sledding, but what about you guys? What did you guys learn this week? I learned that if you run out of toilet paper and you need to get some really quick. Instead of going to the store all I did you just have to make sure that the roommates don't hear you entering in their bathroom. Wait a second. I don't like where this is going. Yeah, dude. I got some nice Charmin Ultra suede is that why it was so much better than the stuff. We usually buy from Adam. It's nice. I had to borrow a roll. No, I found it. Usually it's behind the door, but it was under the sink this time. It's like a roll y'all noticed and we're good weight confession time. I'll give you another role wait. So if you know where it usually is does that mean you've Before wait, let me look at what this stuff this stuff retails for like a dollar fifty a ROM and that's expensive. I went to Sam's Club for that stuff. I'm actually really kind of kind of hurt right now. You think I didn't tell you about it? Well, I'm glad you came clean because I'm sure that was just writing down on your conscience. It was that's horrible disappointed in you Dax and disappointed in you. Well speaking of Roommates actually something I learned this week is that if you live in an apartment with six guys and your it's New Years Eve and you you're planning on staying in the apartment that night probably might want to double-check with everybody make sure they don't also have the same plans because we have a roommate and it wasn't a problem ended up working out. All right, but how we were just gonna awesome rager. We were just going to get some some food, you know have a movie marathon until midnight, you know, all that good stuff we get there and he goes so what are you guys doing tonight? So I'll probably just stay in here not do much he goes. Oh well, so are we and I look around this just him. I'm like wait. Sweet, I guess he had some some people coming over and I mean it sounded like a great party and we ended up just staying in my room eating food and watching conspiracy theories on YouTube, but it was good that does sound like a quality tonight. I just wanted to ask you first though. Like why would you just plan like a movie marathon on New Year's Eve? Couldn't you have thought of anything better to do? Well, I mean, I know you guys are becoming like a boring couple now that you're you're into the later stages of your girlfriend boyfriend ship. We're 45 year-old. It shows man. Like what kind of plans were those? There's so many much better things you could be doing like what what was he gonna do go to some some party with 9 million people there or you could have just came out of your room into the living room and gone to the rager that was being thrown by one of our roommates. I was very looking forward to this movie marathon that we were going to have though. So at that point it was too late. I'd already committed to getting food and not doing anything for the rest of the day. I had sweats on it was the time of my life. And why is this even a problem? Okay. Well the problem is and being confined to my bedroom floor as compared to a couch. So being forced to do it you're already planning to do rather than just doing it well, but not in the comfort of my desires, you know, that's one thing. I just I just can't wrap my head around like look either way. We're Choice was less than Stellar either way. It worked out fine. We were all. Right. I think they all had a good time. I don't even know what they did so we can start the podcast in the comfort of your desire. I do not like that one bit better than bacon. Oh, no, I think those were some really good lessons though. Like those are things I'm not going to repeat next week. You know, I'm not I'm gonna double-check you mean you were gonna repeat them here on the podcast not gonna be that bad. No, I've actually been really good for just you care to know about my resolution. I have zero Scooby-Doo. Yeah, I've been really good to Scooby-Doo has been a zero. I think I've only heard two or three chicken sounds and mating calls or down to minimum. Yeah, I have or it's not mating season. So but hey, I'm not the only one who's been working. I found about 15 pounds of Wingers in the fridge yesterday. So Blake has been worked working on his goal of adding a few pounds. So yeah. Congratulations on that. Blake I'm coming through for with some food real problem is I was trying to get you guys to gain weight but instead I bought all that Wingers that let me to Wingers.

Well, that's better make sure he was it was a step in the right direction it come on guys. I'm really just trying to sound excited and have my good segment intros so It excited that's not the problem. We're dead. I think it's better than the bakey say these guys, but they never want to help out or breaking news. Come on. Anyway, we are now going into are not important News segment. We're really excited this week after last week's story. You know, I really posted a very disappointing story and I'm I'm I was like, I don't know what I was thinking about sharing that story. It was horrible. Like I'm disappointed in myself disgrace. Just let my family down but I'm not gonna let you guys down this week. I'm really excited. But you tell them what you have to do border. I still haven't done it yet, unfortunately, but I will do it. I promise I will I just haven't had the time or desire to go to Walmart in a wife beater crop top and short shorts and ask a associate about a rash cream. I will do it. You know, I deserve it. I shared a horrible news story and that's on me, but I'm not gonna let it happen again this week and that's why I want to get Didn't to my brand new news story which it's pretty wild. So a company is a food company is recalling frozen hash browns and stores in nine states because the potatoes may have pieces of golf balls in them. When I first read this I could not wrap my head around how the heck frozen hash browns would have golf balls in them like it. I just couldn't think of a maybe Here's my thought. So the track maybe the potato farm is right next to the driving range or something along that along those lines and the tractor whatever the picks up the potatoes might have picked up golf balls and like when they blend them up to make the hash browns, maybe they were golf balls in there and they noticed that there was one in there and then they probably saw some more and then they realized that wow, we've been doing this for the past six months and so there's probably people baking Pieces of golf balls inside of the potato and you're exactly right. That's exactly what happened. Yeah, they inadvertently harvested these potatoes and they found that somebody had been practicing their their 9-iron I guess and just driving these and I guess that would be ironing these golf balls into the you know about golfing do have limited golf. Well, I think shipping they were chipping these golf balls into the hash browns and got that silver. Right. I just don't see any other reason for golf ball. You don't think it was like back in the old days. They had to do it by hand. The guy just picked up a golf ball and said yeah that could be a potato and threw it in with the rest of them. But I just think how gross is that? You know, you're frying up some hash browns and you notice a little golf ball sliver in there. And that would taste horrible. That would just ruin hash browns for me even more than I I'm not a big hash browns guy. So ruin your throat. Yeah that if they say that's why they that's why they recalled them because it Choking hazard luckily your golf ball stuck in your esophagus the called it. They don't think it's just because of the white color. Hey, luckily, no injuries have been reported. So be careful out there. Make sure you check your hash browns for golf balls. And I guess any other food for any other athletic equipment because you never know what you're gonna find. Yeah. I didn't see that coming guy goes and waffle with watch out frozen waffle with fried plastic. Now the first thing that came to my mind, I don't know why I just tried plastic is a common sports equipment. Yes. Okay guys, this is mine American Girl doll releases First doll, that's hard of hearing my believe that how many dolls as the first place. My main concern is that mean that they can hear us before that not this one hearing aids real and I would rather have this tall to be honest, but be quite honest but like what do you guys think of that? Are we just gonna leave that there? Well, I just I think that proves it the government is always listening to us even through doll. People are worried about their phones. You know, they talk about something it comes up in an Instagram add but really what we need to worry about is our children's toys. Yeah, the government is using them you just take a little Nancy doing a little tea party. That's he's talking to American Girl doll an American girl. That was like I hate tea don't give me that was like I saw what you did last night get out of your crib. I think what we learned here is that Buzz Lightyear is an FBI agent undercover any that all along? I don't know. I don't know why you did not know that but Toy Story has more value than we think they were always keeping an eye on Andy and whoever else which other kids they were with wait. What have you ever watched Toy Story? I think we must seem to us absolutely all four movies wherever just watching kids, but with that I guess we'll go in to go into my new story here. So this happened in Scotland, but since you know, we're getting to the point where pretty much International cops shut down a massive 3000 person game of hide-and-seek at Ikea and I think my main question comes into the fact that if these guys were playing hide-and-seek there could be more than 3,000 that we're still in there hiding either that or all those people are just terrible at hide and seek. Well wouldn't you run out of spots? I know it's a massive store. It seems like endless opportunities. Like I've literally been lost in there before so I understand where like The hide-and-go-seek part, but how could you play with 3,000 people? I mean, it's I don't know. It's a massive store. I think really the irony of it is the fact that if the cops went in looking for people who are playing hide and seek aren't they also at that point blank. I can see three thousand two people. Those are pretty to pretty good cops. If it only took two of them to find all these people really need to get better at hiding though. I mean, I don't know. I think the article at that point it would be hard to like know who's actually playing. He's like there could be these people just walking down with their stroller and then I gotcha. What do you think? I guess it was like a Facebook event that people signed up for kind of like the raid Area 51 thinking. Well, they say it was like a more productive event and they actually did something rather than just saying they were going to I mean, it's pretty impressive. I've always wanted to play hide-and-seek it like Ikea or something like that. So I think we should really Lee get a group of people to go do this. I think this sounds like a really good time maybe like 15 not 3000 know that stores big enough where you can find or you can hide 3,000 people you put 15 in there. You're never gonna thousand people. That's all they found 3,000 people. You can't just trying to stick six people in a refrigerator and stuff is moving furniture right now. I mean that's just like my childhood dream. And so I really like that new story. I just really wish that those people were better at hide-and-seek either. Of the cops were professional. I don't know what it was. But either way I'm thoroughly impressed. We are talking about Scotland, right? Yeah Scotland Yard, maybe that's how they were so good. But yeah, like I mean with the few less people, I feel like that could be a really successful really really fun thing to do group date at shall we that is free fun. Maybe not ethical but it would be awesome. 1,500 people are invited bring your own date. Yeah. BYOD, that's really making an Instagram page about this when putting it on our stories, so remember the date. Yeah, stay tuned for details. It's gonna be awesome after Porter buys his rash cream. Oh, yeah, that'd be like a good punishment. Yeah, if your punishment you have to be the first person to go find everybody that'll be the punishment for that week that actually be real easy. Yeah tell that to the 3,000 people at everything to find one person finding one person and Ikea you think Easy out of 3,000. Yes quite yeah. Have you ever been to Ikea yeah, and I never could I've only been out there. I think they literally designed those places to be a maze like apple kind of like Darcy. Will you work at I've gotten lost in it 14 times and I've only been there through teen that's how confusing it is. Yeah, so I work started working there and I literally got lost like the second day. I started wandering around and eventually I just ask somebody where I was supposed to be because I had no clue of wandering. My lunch was in my hand I could Find the breaker probably. Yeah, I feel like a little kid on the first day of school lost. You think they would take us out there. If we came to play hide-and-seek there. I could not tell you that. I don't think I'm allowed to say yes or no. Yes, or quite frankly play hide and seek in his own work. Just take off your bag. You should walk around and find customers who are trying to hide from he so really I think I'd be good at it at this point. That was a good way to peace those two things together. I'm very Rest by your example. Thank you. Appreciate that on a resume. That is what makes him a great expert hide-and-seek player. Perfect eyes. They're you have the news of this week. As always we're going to have the pulls up make sure to vote for your favorite stories and not just your favorite people so that way we get an honest amount of feedback because I quite frankly I'm tired of winning all the time and one one time you lost all the other ones.

I don't want to hear you after you said wakey wakey eggs, and bacon or whatever you said, but anyways, as we know as you guys probably can tell through listen to this podcast. I'm a pretty opinionated guy. I have my views on things and I just kind of wanted to run somebody you guys to see what you thought. I should have my views on the world, and I want to see if you can prove me wrong. All right, let's do it. Let's do it. I'm ready. I'm always ready. All right, here's my first thought cereal is soup soup is warm cereal is not warm. All right, where does in the definition of soup does it say that it has to be warm? What is one soup other than cereal that you eat cold? There's like raspberry soup strawberry soup. But yeah, I don't syrup know I've had them before in Brazil. No, it was on a cruise. So it was technically the middle of the ocean. Okay, here we go a soup by the definition is a liquid dish typically made of by boiling meat fish or vegetables in stock or water typically, but not always have you had any cereal with meat because if you have that is horribly disgusting typically use one that always you can stir around super you don't over stir around Syria. Because it gets soggy. Okay, fine. Well, how about this then there's that Pop-Tarts are ravioli. What is see that I can go for because what is a ravioli? It's like a little pasta shells something inside boiled ravioli is ravioli. Even before you boil it. I like a noodles have to be boiled in order to make them ravioli. Well, I mean, oh and that package before and yeah still there still ravioli. Yeah, but they're already cooked. Nobody stuff to cook them. I'm you know, apparently if you just hate it well according to the definition. It's just a small pasta envelope containing ground meat cheese or vegetables, okay. Okay, there you have it pasta envelope. Yeah, but what is it pop tart? It's like a cooked pasta. It's not a cook pasta bread pasta. It's a it's a ravioli desert bread pasta and expect me to be okay with it. I just did now believe it. All right. All right - salt of all right. So I already got I already got Porter on my side here. You're the last one pizza rolls are Italian gushers? Okay, I like that. Wow, that's out. There is no death. There we go. There we go. Something we can agree on. All right, it's good. Okay, we're good. I didn't have to try to convince you that beef jerky is chewing gum for Cowboys the some doing pretty good here. Yeah. All right note. I think that perfect sounds bad. Now you don't just chew on it chewing tobacco is too real for Napa. There we go. There we go. He's chewing gum doesn't dissolve as it's in your mouth. If you got a chance to convince us of some things. I want to have a quick chance. All right. We'll see what you got. I mean, I don't know if it can be the Italian gushers, but That was good. All right, let me give it a shot. Wii Sports is the best video game of all times. Have you ever played Wii Sports Resort? Wow, you just destroyed my argument in one statement. Absolutely. You are right the basketball and ping pong games on there were epic. Absolutely. Love them. No. The best about Wii Sports Resort is the little platform when you can sword fight with you - yeah, that was the best part about Wii Sports Resort or Skydive. Yeah like that that game was masterful like you Say that there has been a better game that has come out since then there were so many options. That's the thing you could do. Whatever you wanted. I can you guys argue that or know that you can do whatever you wanted know that that we Sports Resort is I could not die while doing parachute aches just kidding. I can get behind that. I'll get behind that. It was good. Oh wait, although I don't mean to Axton growing up, you know, the the tanks game that we would always play that game was bomb. It was you just driver ahead a good because we don't know what it's called. It was it was on we play I remember that. It was called it was called Paint. That's what the game never even heard of that. So that's my vote discrediting that vetoed and accent obviously doesn't have a statement but I'm gonna ask you guys one more thing. This is something I found online. Obviously. I'm not intellectual enough to come up with this but it says college is all about convincing your parents that you are studying and convincing your friends that you are not studying. Do you believe that to be true or not? True? No, I have no idea what you're talking about. I always only study which I have to say because my family listens. This podcast exactly Point proven always study. I only always study because yeah exactly. I feel like I've never had to convince my parents and I'm studying. They just don't believe it. Anyways, they just haven't looked at your grades. Now. They know my grades are fine that that seems to me to be like what a big portion of colleges. What about you Jackson? Do you have any questions you want to ask us? Yeah. Well, I got a couple one of them best movie of all time Shrek. Absolutely. I cannot argue that I love Shrek the memes they've done with that in the funny videos. They've made of that absolutely incredible animatic art. It lives on forever in the hearts of Americans after literally tonight. We watched don't even know was probably an hour's worth of like just Trek video visit. I don't know if we should admit that to all of our view listening like it wasn't on purpose it just like one thing like, oh that's actually kind of funny at the Dexter. It was either or well tell you if you guys get bored go ahead on YouTube and type in raising. Shrek raising Shrek. It's life-changing. It's like 30 seconds long, but you won't regret it. What about this one memes are just dad jokes with pictures see that one. I have a little bit of trouble with because I've seen a lot of memes that have nothing to do with something that a dad would say, that's the thing is like I feel like there's a lot of jokes that say their dad jokes, but like my dad wouldn't say them. Yeah. I think there's only like a few classic dad jokes like a dad joke, really? They just means like it's a stupid joke. Really? Yeah, which I'll memes tend to be stupid jokes with a picture but some of them are like, I don't know tied to something newer than a dad wouldn't even understand or know about so I couldn't have no dude. My dad's hit you're saying that because he because of the previous college segment, aren't you? Glad he's studying. He's studying right now. It's gonna go get ready for next semester. I don't waste my time on the Annette were making podcasts. I promise but now I see I'm glad to see that I could kind of help you guys get some good views on the world there. I convince you many of the I convinced you for the most part and I'll take my My Double Wear I can wear I can but you guys is I'm still trying to ease into but we'll see how it goes. Thanks for tuning in this week guys. We hope you enjoyed our 15-second debates as you can see. I won basically all of them. What are you talking about? You didn't even participate you just Folded gave the best opinions. Absolutely. Thank you like Supino. I gave the best opinions my guess, but thanks for listening again guys. Just a reminder to stay woke this week and we'll catch you next week.\",\n",
       " \"On the first ever episode of Kream in your Koffee, Katie talks about tips for Christmas shopping. We also get a little insight into who and what we’ll be hearing about in next weeks episode! Hello. Hello. Hello everyone. This is Katie and we are here together on our first ever episode of cream in your coffee. Thank you so much guys for humoring me on this podcast Journey. It's been a huge goal of mine for the past few years. I finally just growing a pair and jumping right into it and seeing how it goes. So, thank you again for bearing with me here. Alrighty guys, so I figured for the first episode why not jump into a topic that is so exciting for pretty much everybody out there just around the corner and seven or eight days. We have the wonderful Christmas and I'm so excited Christmas is a great time of year for me. I just love the spirit of happiness and joy and the giving spirit. I love every single part of it and I hope that you guys are excited for it to obviously it would definitely I say that most people are I find most excited about receiving gifts around Christmas time. I'm definitely the opposite I get really really awkward when someone gives me a gift but I get so excited to give someone else a gift and just to see their faces when they open it. I'd like to think that I'm pretty good with gifts. I usually think of something like thoughtful or I'll even make something for someone so it really just depends on the person obviously, but I don't know doing something nice for someone always feels good, right? Anyways, so I wanted to just give a couple tips for you guys because I did work retail for several years of my life and I'm honestly very very happy that I am not this year because I hate crowds and even though I work with people I kind of hate people. So seeing frantic men and women running all over the mall trying to figure out what to buy their loved ones for a holiday. That's like usually two days away is a little stressful for me, but this year I don't have to worry about But thank goodness. So my first tip for you guys is going to seem probably unhelpful right this minute, but in future Christmases to come it's going to save you big time. It's going to save you stress and it's going to save you money come December so I'm going to say tip. Number one Santa knew what was up. Okay, make a list and check that shit twice. I don't mean make a list right before you go out shopping the day of gentlemen. I'm sure your shopping Christmas Eve. Stop fucking doing that. I mean throughout the year make a list of things that your friends and family make comments about so things that they always use things that they want things they enjoy And this is going to save you a headache because not only is this list going to have a backup list of things that you can buy if you are totally stuck on gifts, but you also have something to reference all year long. When you can pick things up, so this is where it's going to save you financially. You're not coming around to December of next year and you're like shit. I don't have enough money to buy Christmas gifts or you know, you see those memes that are like it looks like people going to be getting a Merry Christmas message for Christmas. That's what my bank account looks like. No, you're going to go it's going to be July and your best friend Janine really likes, you know, Marc Jacobs Daisy perfume. So you pick it up in July and then you have it in your closet for Janine come to Brr. Okay, it's going to save you a gift that you have to remember to buy and it's going to save you money in December when you're already forking out the dough tip number one make a list kind of wraps into this number two or tip number two, because tip number two is by throughout the year things are going to go on sale people always get so excited for like Black Friday shopping and Boxing Day sales. I will say Boxing Day tends to have a little bit better. Sales, I personally find four things then Black Friday, but I've had this conversation with people before where they're like, oh my God, like Black Friday deals are so good. But people are lined up around the block. I guarantee you that Best Buy has pretty much that same deal on a television Midway through the year. You just don't notice because you're not looking it up. So just be conscientious of what you're looking to buy and when the deals are honestly check throughout the year and you're going to save yourself at least like four. Out a chunk of dough in December at least you're saving yourself that financial burden if not finding the deals as well and saving money that way so tip number one is make a list and tip number two is by throughout the year. The last tip that I'll leave you guys with for the Christmas season is the three gift rule. So this is something that I initially started doing for children and realize that it was also a really good starting point for gifts for your adult friends as well. So I the gifts are very simple one thing you want one thing you need and one thing to read. So one thing they want something they've brought up something that they've mentioned to you that they would love to have. But they just can't afford right now or whatever one thing they need. So ladies, you know, if your man's taking his pants off and his boxers look like moths have gotten into his underwear drawer. He needs some briefs and or Underoos or boxers or whatever the hell you call them. Go get you a man's some underwear. So again, the first two is one thing you want and one thing you need one thing you read. I love this one. Honestly, this is great. I love it because I used to read all the time and now it takes me five months to read a book that I would probably finish in two days. So one thing to read gets everyone on that educational truck and gives their brain a little bit of a workout. Now the one thing to read is also kind of a fun little gift because it gives the other person that you are giving to an insight into your brain and what you would kind of read or at least what you would suggest for them. So it opens up some Avenues of may be an author that they never thought to look into or some storylines that they might like that they didn't know they would so it's like a gift that keeps on giving you know, it's wonderful. So those are my three Christmas tips for you guys tip 1 make a list and check it twice tip to shop throughout the year rather than leaving it as one huge task and lump sum of money that you need to Shell out come December and tip 3 is try the three gift rule. So hopefully you guys found those tips at least minimally helpful. I found that anyone that I have told those things to obviously prior to December 17th have actually found that quite helpful to kind of do it throughout the year. Like I said, it just takes a lot of Burden off of you and the third tip at least helps you to have a platform to start with on how and where to start getting gifts. So guys, like I said, I'm a huge fan of Christmas as much as I love the spirit of it though. Like if you know me in person, you've seen me dressed up for work for Christmas full on Santa socks the whole getup that being said with all this excitement that I have for the Christmas season. I don't actually decorate my place. Um, I think I have one stocking that A friend gave me several years ago. And that's the one Christmas decoration that I have and that goes On my door, so I'm not a huge decorator surprisingly enough. I will be having a guest on next week though for next episode and her family goes all out. So we will definitely be talking with her about her Christmas traditions and how they decorate. Now you guys are probably thinking like what the fuck is this person talking about she loves Christmas, but she doesn't decorate what is up with that. I don't know. I'm just not a huge decorating person. It might also be because I have two small dogs and they just get into everything. I also live alone. So I think it just for me at least seems a little silly to set up a whole bunch of Christmas decorations just to take them down for myself to look at them. I don't know if that's just a lot of effort with A lot of return I guess. I don't know. I don't like Snow either. So the weather recently hasn't exactly been my favorite, but given that it is Christmas. I will take a nice fluffy layer of snow for Christmas day that's acceptable, I guess so mother nature. Feel free to send us a little bit of snow, but no ice no hail and no freezing rain. Thank you. So I'm not a huge fan of snow and I don't decorate my place and I'm not a huge fan of receiving gifts. I mean you guys are probably thinking why does this woman keeps saying that she loves Christmas. So here is why I love Christmas. As I said before. I love the joy that everyone has I love the good mood that it puts most people in although I hate snow. I do like when it looks like a winter wonderland - the slush and the slipping So the joy I guess but absolutely my number one favorite thing about this season is seasonal coffees. So eggnog latte is Starbucks. You know, what the fuck is up? That is my favorite. Honestly, eggnog anything throw me some rum in that nog and we got a good time going on and also just the little the cops to Like just the festive little cups that they give you I love every part of it. Yeah, if you didn't catch that, I love eggnog. So in case anyone wants to gift me eggnog I can do something fun with that. Maybe I don't I don't fucking know if anyone has any ideas of eggnog cocktails as well. I recently discovered an eggnog colada so fucking good. Maybe we'll talk about that on the next episode but Yeah, I mean definitely go check just Starbucks and check out the eggnog latte is because if you seen my stories I pretty much have at least one a day for the entire month of December and then I wonder why I gained weight and it's actually because I've been drinking all the cream and egg. Nog me now as for Christmas traditions, I don't really do much. Typically I hang out with my family on Christmas Day. As most people do my family as you know, as you get older people typically end up moving all over the place. So this year we won't be having a big family Christmas. I am lucky enough to have a fantastic boyfriend who is hosting Christmas Eve dinner this year. So I'll be able to spend some time with him and hopefully I will be able to visit my brother and his fiance who are actually expecting so I'm very excited to see them. And say hello to their little nugget that is not born yet. But I think I got the right to rub her belly and say hello to the outer womb given. I'm the baby's Aunt I don't know Roxy if you're listening to this, please let me know if I'm not allowed to do that. So I don't make an awkward situation down the road. Anyways guys. Thank you so much for listening. Like I said huge huge. Huge shout out to every single one of you that has listened because I am extremely nervous, but I'm really happy that I put myself out there and gave it a try. So thank you so so much guys, and we will see you next episode where I will be interviewing one of my good friends Katarina who like I said, her family is a huge Christmas family, and we'll be learning a little bit more about what they do for Christmas on the next episode. Thanks for tuning in guys. Bye.\",\n",

I think some of our stories are similar in terms of you know, a lot of us are like Star Wars fans and with the force awakens that came out and new Wars toys and all those things they kind of reinvigorated kind of the kid in us and at that point I was on Instagram and I started seeing some accounts actually posting toy photography was like leaking into my design, you know account my design world and I was just kind of Blown Away like that's pretty awesome to kind of back up I do as invisible element. That's my company my business. I do animation which call motion design design illustration. Branding so I live in that creative space and so I've been in the in the kind of production world, but most on the on the post side, so I'd work with editors and you know create these great shows and then I would package them with graphics and so never kind of behind the camera, but it's something I've always was interested in learning how to use use a camera doing photography doing video and kind of around the same time. That's when all this stuff kind of hit with with Force awakens and toys. Okay, people are doing this. Maybe it's okay. If I do it too. I'm an adult but I still have still love it. Right, right. Exactly. And it's so funny man that you started around the force awakens because I feel like a lot of people did I feel like a lot of accounts started around that time. Do you agree? I do I think if anything, I mean there are a lot of guys who've been doing it way before that. I mean we're talking like five six ten years before that even kind of cropped up, but I'd say it's kind of a Resurgence. It was just becoming more well known and I think Instagram Umm, you know helps out with just being able to share imagery along with story. I think that was just like the perfect platform for more kind of eyes on it totally and so I got ended up getting a camera which I'm still using my Canon 6D does about like, I think it's 2015 like December of 2015 and really wanted to kind of learn how to use it again understanding kind of conceptually how it works in my video production, but never really doing it myself. So I got the camera. And then really was interested in trying to figure out how to do low light photography and I had some figures that I received the first black series figure was the Boba Fett like at that point that I got that for Christmas along with like Darth Maul and some of the OG like original Black Series figures, which I love to this day and I had those and like it try to you know, seeing what people are doing on Instagram with toy photography. I'm just going to do it and see where it goes and Just learn as I'm kind of playing with the toys and you know had a couple shots and like this is this is really fun because one I'm around toys and that kind of reinvigorating my creativity. But then also I'm learning as I'm doing it, you know kind of adding something else to the the the tool belt of just, you know, creative tools that I use everyday so nice. So when you first started out, did you have anybody that really? Inspired you to take it to the next level. I know that you when I first came across your account you really seemed to have a grasp of toy photography from the beginning and like you said you had that you had that background in media and marketing. And so that kind of gave you a step up on you know, your your journey as a toy photographer. Did you have anybody that you kind of tried to emulate or model your toy photography after and the beginning? I think most of it was just like kind of Discovery at first. So I mean obviously, you know, there's there's a lot of guys like everybody I think everybody's mentioned. Sorry bananas for the most part Johnny he was as far as like doing like Star Wars toy photography. He was kind of the first where he already had a kind of his his foot planted in the ground. He's been you know sharing stuff and that was some of the stuff that I had seen that kind of to begin with Captain Chaos five models some of those guys were some of the original ones that I remember, And it was cool seeing how they they approached taught photography for myself. I'm like man. I don't I don't usually go. I don't want to go outside. I don't really have these beautiful locations. So I thought what if what can I do indoors and again doing compositing doing that type of stuff for video kind of was like, you know, I can actually do this with a computer screen. I don't need to like print out a background even though that works. Well Ram I can pull up I can choose right now. I can go and find Find like 10 images or screenshots from movie and then figure out which one works best for this figure which you know, I like the lighting on this or whatever and then kind of just worked on using kind of the screens for my backgrounds because it's just one less thing. I had to think about I didn't have to build a diorama. I didn't have to go and find an image then print it it was just right there. And so kind of I was trying to just figure out how can I do things efficiently in quick and get something that still looks pretty pretty professional pretty solid so nice. Did you coin that phrase did you Rama digital diorama? Is that something that you coined or did someone else kind of coin that because I know that like you said that that's something that you kind of specialize in. Is that something that you made up at the time? I mean, I don't I don't know at the time. I was trying to figure out a good you know for myself a name for like what I could call it and that just kind of I like wordplay. And so that kind of felt right? I think when I used a hashtag. I think there might have been like maybe less than 10 people who had done it, but I don't really know there wasn't any kind of like overarching like context of like this is using a screen for background. It just seemed like it was kind of random gotcha, but I kind of started using that because I was like, okay this makes sense and it sounds good too. Well, it's Anonymous. It's synonymous whenever I think of your work always think of well, he's got some sort of digital element involved somehow even if it's a you know, you have the practical Dioramas involved you do have that digital effect. And I love that. I do enjoy your your digital dioramas that you do and it's amazing how you seamlessly incorporate those backgrounds into your photos. And I think one of the first ones that I really just stared at for a long time was the Jango Fett and you had him just placed on your table is either desk or table and you had just a lamp positioned over head and he was like had a blaster he was pointing down at the ground. I was just amazed. I was like, wow, that just looks so real it looks so it looked in scale and looked able to be understood but it didn't look like a toy if that makes sense. It look real right look like an actual, you know a performer or an actor on a screen. So yeah, that one's that also like exactly everything you're talking about. I think that's what I find so but like I get so much joy out of with this hobby is like how do you take a figure that may look amazing? Like a hot toys figure or or you know mezco stuff or really anything Black Series take something that already looks pretty good. But how do you kind of sell this this shot or how do you sell this concept and doing things like trying to marry a background with foreground elements with the you know, the subject in the center and bringing in lights that match the background color. Once you kind of get all these of like kind of elements together you can really The the visual pretty pretty easy. I mean because even if you've got something in the foreground, it's going to give you it's going to give you more depth if it's blurred out. It doesn't really matter. It's just something there and it makes you feel like you're actually within this scene in that it also helps with scaling to of course, but yeah, it's so much fun and in for me every time I set something up in my head. I'm like, okay, I think this will look pretty cool. But you don't really know until you get behind your you know, the camera like if you're looking at your display. Say or looking through the lens or even getting it on your on your computer to edit. You don't really know how that's going to look until you you see the shot and that's what super exciting even if you set it up, you know where everything is, you know, what elements are are being used. It still feels kind of like at this surprised when you actually get that that final shot that you can kind of work with so, it's fun. It's addicting man levels. It is so addicting. Do you feel like you have improved your process and your workflow since you first started out do you feel like that time frame that you have? I know both of us have time constraints on you know shooting. Do you feel like your workflow has kind of changed the way you approach toy photography. Are you more methodical? How do you feel like that's changed? Yeah. I think it's that's a real that's a good question. And I think there's a lot of things that have kind of ebbed and flowed from the beginning, you know, really dialing in kind of the did your drama technique and then then from there like at the beginning it was just like mostly using maybe a floor and in the did Rama image on the screen and then the figures but then I kind of started pushing out a little bit more maybe using more kind of physical props just kind of fill out the scene and then you know while after that maybe it was more about hey a lot of these guys are using physical dioramas and they just look really good in that being more the focus with the subject. Maybe still using the screen for a sky Or just to cast some color right? And then then it's like well, I really want to do an all you no, no no screens want to try. What is it? What can I get with just a full diorama pieces or you know, it's fun to kind of just kind of play around with different different techniques. I'd love to kind of do more, you know, kind of outdoor explosion type stuff, that'd be fun. But it's just a little bit more difficult to actually make that happen. But yeah. Yeah, it's so much fun. You guys they do that. Sorry. Go ahead. I was gonna say it's just so much fun to play with different techniques and again being inspired by all the amazing guys here doing other things that I'm not focusing on. Yes. It's incredible it is and you know with the people that are able to go out and do the outdoor photography and you know versus the people who are not able to do that, you know, it's it's a different workflow like people that are able to have that, you know, environment where they can manipulate every single and you know setting and every single every background, you know, like you were saying, yeah, you're able to control the end product so much easier versus going out in the elements and you really have to have a feel of how the day is going to go when the lights going to be there and it I feel like, you know, not saying that one is better than the other because they're they're two entirely different types of shooting but I feel like when are able to go out, you know outside in the elements that you you know, it's almost like it's almost like painting, you know, like painting a portrait but you have no idea where it's going to go. You know what I mean? Like, yeah, you don't have you really have an idea you want to feel you have an emotion that you want but you really don't know because there's so many variables when you're out in the elements universe is shooting indoors and having those shots you're able to you know, you're not be like it control exactly and people that are able to do the outdoors. And able to control and master it. It's amazing. It is really is it's a different level for sure. I've tried it many times and I don't feel like I've succeeded so far but I definitely enjoy doing it. Yeah, I feel the same way sometimes honestly, so those guys props everybody who goes outside and shoots. Yes, you're incredible and inspiring so keep it up incredibly inspiring for sure for sure. So do you approach toy photography for the enjoyment? Enjoyment aspect of the process or do you do it more for the posting? Because I know a lot of people enjoy the process of toy photography more than they enjoy like the community aspect and then some people love the community aspect more. What do you feel like you enjoy more the nice thing is that I actually enjoy both sides of it. I'll gladly answer your question. But know the process to me is exciting again being more kind of creative minded. I Of to I mean just the whole process and trying to figure out how do you how do you get the shot? Trying new? Like I said tick Trips Trips tricks and techniques or even just new new tools. So if you're using like practical like fog or smog in a can or things like that seeing seeing how that changes what you can produce I love that side of thing. I love the creative like being the Creator and in bring it all together and seeing what you come up with but I would say what keeps me in to a photography is the community not necessarily posting the final shot and getting you know comments and likes and all that stuff. But it's this type of thing where you and I we met over our love for toys, right and we're talking about it and it's something that I think everybody needs something that they're passionate about that. It's not about making money. It's not about getting notoriety. It's about something that you just I love to do and knowing that there's another you know, there's a ton of people who come from different walks of life that do this and we have this really great Community who loves to share and who loves to be inspired by one another lift each other up. That's what keeps me in it because I mean it at the end of the day if you're only going off of what your return on investment is, like if you want to put it that way sure there are some shots where I'm Like hey, this is a great shot and it gets like 230 likes Ryan some other ones get over a thousand or whatever it is. It doesn't really matter the numbers. But if you're just basically kind of going off those metrics then at a certain point you can be like, okay. What why am I doing this? Yeah, and the reason for me is the community in the relationships. So I love that. I love that, you know having that burnout kind of happen whenever you're trying to just gain momentum in likes or Is it yeah, it's exhausting and it's a never-ending goal. You know, what I mean? Like is 10,000 going to be enough 20,000 30,000. When is it end? And at the end of the day like you said thing that's the most enjoyable aspect for me to is being able to you know connect with people like you like minded people who enjoy the Hobby and who enjoy creating content that's going to inspire and uplift and be able to you know, I love what Jesse said on the previous. You know, he does a picture and a help somebody through their day and it just gives them a little boost, you know, and that to me is worth it, you know the investment that I made figured that I purchased a diorama I made by hand or whatever it was that to me was worst, you know that investment. And so that's amazing me I love this community people that don't really understand the toy Community maybe that are looking out from the outside and and I just encourage you just to get in. I lived in the people that are out there putting out great content there so accessible, you know, if you want to be able to learn just send us a message and we will help you man. Just be approachable. Of course, you know be respectful, you know, you don't want to yeah, you don't want to foster a community. That's disrespectful. That's something I definitely don't want to have especially on, you know, our personal, you know pages that we like to do like we want to be respected and we will show you respect as well. So yeah. Yeah, and that's that's another thing. I would say just in general the community is great at sharing at interaction inspiring uplifting. But also, yeah, you're right. I think everyone recognizes the amount of effort that we put into our own work in so even if somebody's inspired like oh, wow, that's shot that you did was great. I want to try that too. And a lot of times people will attempt it and say hey I was inspired by so and so you go check out their work and so over and over again. I'm seeing more of that. Type of attitude versus okay. I'm blurred in this new thing. I learned what looks best as snow like what what is it flour or baking soda? I figured this trick out this technique now, I'm not going to share it with anybody. Like usually it's right opposite. Like hey guys, I checked check this out. This is what it looks like with flour. This is what it looks like a big mess on whatever it is, you know, people are so so willing to just engage and like you said, usually if somebody gets used me a DM and I see it like I'll reply and say Hey, you know that X4 reaching out. Even if it's just asking a simple question or whatever it might be. So again, you know, obviously you give people respect then that's how you'll get respect to so exactly love the community love the community me too, man. So I'm curious. How long does it take we kind of talked about this earlier about your process. How long does it really take on the timeline that you have a shot in your mind till you get the shot? Ready? Sure, you get the process going and then it's able to be posted. Like how long does it take you because I know it takes me you know, let's just say I have an idea I'm always got ideas. Right? So we're all as toy photographers. We always have ideas and shots that are kind of like maybe a bucket shot or a shot that we've been wanting to do. But whenever I set up and from that timeline, it normally takes me about 10 hours from being able to shoot and edit and then post how long does that take? Take for you to do. I'm curious. Yeah, I it's fun because I kind of experimented with it a little bit. Obviously the more you do a certain technique the the more efficient you become or if you're able to, you know, keep things set up overnight or for a few days like you're shooting in a room or something and you can just leave all the lights up that makes the process a little bit more, you know more efficient I guess but you know, honestly, so, I'm sure most people I like this too. I mean, I'm also a collector I love just Having the toys and being able to have them in my office like as I'm working. I usually have like a few figures that are on my desk in front of my in front of between am my computer monitor and it might be a few figures that I've planned to shoot next and they're just kind of there and I might if I'm waiting on some client feedback or just need to take a little break take a figure maybe pose. It just see what I can do with the figure and you know, that kind of helps me before I actually get to setting up the the shot. That helps me kind of visualize. Okay. Oh this you know, maybe get Spider-Man in a certain pose and see what angle works best. Like, what's the best silhouette if he's you know, all crouched up and he's got his arms out and is one leg is forward and one's kind of bent back behind them. Like what angle provides the best silhouette so I can I can kind of do that while I'm in a sense like during the day like while I'm working more or less good and so I usually will have a figure there that helps me kind of Just while I'm coming up with the idea help me feel like once I step into the room when I'm going to start shooting. I've got a couple of options from they're setting up depending on what I need to do. It can take maybe 30 minutes to an hour just to kind of get everything right and then take a few test shots, see how things are looking and then maybe, you know do some adjustments and then after that I'll probably spend two hours if maybe maybe more maybe less depending But when I set up I like to get more than like one or two shots, right? I want to use that set up again. I like efficiency. I like to get as much out of it as possible. So maybe even uses the same setup with like the Cantina or the Smugglers retreat but shoot for different figures that work with it with a similar setup or maybe different angle, maybe change the color of the light. So it doesn't feel like the exact same thing. So I you know kind of just depends but I did this all at night after My family's kind of gone to bed. So I've got a little time where I can just focus. Nobody needs me. I don't have to you know, I don't do it in the morning where I only have like 30 minutes before I have to take kids to school. So I've got time and it's really up to me like how late I want to stay up to it and it just rains it's the morning so do that get the shots and then once I maybe it's the next day, I'll pull all the shots off the camera and put it on my computer. I use Photoshop to do a the editing the raw editing and and adding effects and all that stuff. That's just what I've done for years. So it makes the most sense and I'm I'm fast at doing it and then I'd spend maybe for each one maybe 30 minutes just to touch up most of the time. I'm sure all you guys can can can relate there's always tends to be like dust or Little Fibers or things like that that you don't see until you actually blow up the shot on your screen you like. Oh come on or like a reflection of like the hyper real. It's better that I just shot reflections of the ceiling fan in his helmet, you know, like stupid things like that. You don't notice until you actually get it up in your working on kind of the editing side. So, you know spend anywhere between like 30 minutes to maybe an hour on some of the individual shots, but then I've got, you know, five six shots from that session that the shooting session that I can kind of post overtime or save a few and post a few weeks afterwards, but Again, just try to be efficient with the time that you're spending because we spend a lot of time doing this. So it's true and I've noticed that you kind of have moved away from your three post theme shots and you've kind of gone more of a individual shot per shot. And when I say that I mean your Instagram layout, so the way that when you look at your feed you used to do the the three-shot themed and is that something that you kind of just over time? Moved over just because of necessity or what was the reasoning for that? Well, I it's funny. I still in my mind. I'm always thinking. Okay. I still want to have my rose nice and tidy and actually the last like the Vader in the some of the Power Ranger stuff. I shot recently. I did three of each of those but sometimes what I'll do is so if you kind of go back through once I've completed a row, I'll have like maybe a grouping where it's like to on a row and then one kind of straggler and then right above that there will be two more from maybe that session. So there's like a grouping of four and then two that are stacked on each other that might go together or it might be one row that's like completely just random but then I start back up with maybe a full row or you know, it kind of will it will change I'm always using that mindset but I was getting to the point when I was like man, okay, I take shot. I've got to get three shots every time I shoot. Yeah, and it was it was it was just kind of silly and like I don't need to This and once people see one shot from the setup. If you're showing the same thing if it's just a little bit different it's not as interesting. So unless they're like really Dynamic and maybe a little bit different maybe the same figure. Maybe I'll just do like one or put now that you can do multiple images in one post you can do that before then you can you know have like five images from the session just in one post. So yeah, you know, you don't want to spam everybody it that can get annoying when it's just the same thing over and Over again, so that's true. And I'm glad that you said that because I have attempted to do this three-shot seemed Instagram groupings before and it is exhausting because you know, you do have that one, you know, perfect shot that you had in mind and then you kind of have to frame that perfect shot with two other side shots and it's it does get repetitive. Especially when you're you know, looking through someone's feed and you're like you kind of know, what's the filler shots and what? The shots that are like, you know the actor seaside. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And I think for me I've kind of moved away from that to just being able to focus on I love what Trevor Williams always talks about. Is that quality over quantity. Oh, yeah, and he is a master of that phrase. Like he will only post the quality, you know, he doesn't just post the post and something that I kind of look up to him as a as a forerunner and that aspect and you know growing as artists that's something that we kind of have to balance and juggle is like I want to post because I want to put for as my creativity but at the same time I want to put out what something that's going to be enjoyable and something that's my best, you know, because you don't want to just throw something out there that it's just filler, you know, exactly. Yeah. So I mean, I'm always just because of the type of personality I am I'm always curating everything I post and thinking ahead of what's going to be next or what my row will look like so people still can see that I feel like I've I've gots there's some intentionality behind when I post versus just like here's a shot post. Here's a shot. Here's one right. I still am curating in a sense, but try not to be as obvious with it. So ain't going back to the Mantra of the toy photographers podcast that we are storytellers. Eller's that's something that you kind of emulate so well is that you're always telling a story and your shots. It's not just you know, just shots that you throw up there. You have some sort of element of Storytelling that you're doing and there's a lot of emotion. I think that's why so many people are able to connect and to enjoy your content so much and that's one reason I do, you know is just a storytelling aspect and the imagination just kind of is able to run with your shots and you post you know, like right now I'm looking at a dart. All shot. That's a portrait, even though there's not a lot of context the emotion that's kind of, you know emitted from that shot. You know, I'm thinking what is he looking at? What is going on? You know, what is he thinking and the storytelling aspect is what I enjoy so much of it. So that's something that I really appreciate from your content. Well, thank you. I mean that's that's what I wrote. That's why I respond to as well. There are times when I'm just posting a figure because I think hey, let's if this was like a product shot. But how would that appear? You're not surely focusing on? Okay. What is this this character thinking so there are those that are just nice to kind of like I just want to take a picture of this photo are take a picture of this character and you know set that up and I love that but also, you know that can get kind of dull for me. And so I like being able to take it takes more time, but I like being able to think more conceptually of like, okay, what would be what would be funny to? Put this character like what situation would be funny or interesting or how do you bring a couple characters from different universes together in that? Ultimately? I think one people respond better to there's so many people in the community taking amazing amazing shots, and they may just be like, hey, there's the figure beautiful scenery, you know action pose Action Shot whatever and it looks amazing, but I think it's really the stuff that stands out are the things. Is that have a little bit of thought and concept behind it? Right? Because it just it's just different from what you know, what a lot of people maybe tend to lean towards but again not taking away from from their craft at all. But I'm just drawn more towards like you said kind of the storytelling or the the thought behind what the scene is I suppose and you know, it's proven that emotion, you know is kind of the key to Long. Her memory. So if you have an emotion tied to a shot, you know, you're going to remember that shot and I love when you're able to either get a laugh or a maybe even a contemplatively shot where you're thinking Hmm, you know what's going on here? And that's to me the most compelling, you know content is when you're I'm not the best personally at the at the funny shots. I I tend to deline more dramatic serious. You sure hero pose or Or you know Batman standing over something and brooding or right, you know what I mean? But but the people that do the people that do that, you know, the funny shots like you've been doing a lot of great content with that that hyper-real Darth Vader which is so funny with the the little things that you included in those shots. Do you do you feel like there's some people out there you want to give a shout out to that you love that are the more humorous Instagram accounts. Yeah. I mean, I think obviously there's a Two guys that I kind of run run with quite a bit. So every day I'm talking with Spencer with sweet pics Isaiah Takahashi. Yeah, but look sirs. I joke, I sometimes will I call on black seriously? But yeah is that it's good. Yeah. Let's see Richie Sonos rain and Jack's plastic action. I mean everybody if you're in the community, you're familiar with those guys. I talked with them regularly like probably every single day those guys each one of them they inspire me and again, I think so much. It's not really even like one person or you know, three people if you asked me to tell you what are the top three people that inspire you or whatever that I stress out even thinking about that because there's so many people who I greatly admire greatly. Who are doing such great work and even people who are building their own dioramas and focusing more on that people who are building little props Dwayne shoots toys recently. He's been doing it at he's always been doing really elaborate setups, you know, you can you know, printing out the wallpapers and posters and all these making these little little props that are just they're gorgeous like Again, that that's inspiring to see there's people who are doing Lego toy photography that are just insane the amount of time. It takes to build like a Lego diorama. I know in in light it and that type of stuff or like I said, even the Practical going outside and figuring out how to shoot with fireworks or indoors with diorama. So there's there's so many guys doing it and I think there were call it speaks for itself. So the ones that are humorous the ones that take it more seriously the more that a indoor versus outdoor, there's just there's so many great talented folks that might get to talk to and and kind of been our estimate so an inspired by so nice I tend to I guess I don't put people in boxes. I wasn't meaning that at all should not sure what I meant was just really when I ever whenever I think of people that are you know, No humorous. I think of like the hot Kenobi's or like yeah, I think of you know, like you said you mentioned plastic action. He's got some great shots that always crack me up with his plastic Ballers shots that he does and you know, when you when you Branch out and start doing different themed shots, you know, it doesn't really put you in a box because toy photography is Limitless. There's just endless amount of creativity that you can put into it and For me personally, you know, I you know, I toured a gravitate towards the more humorous ones because sometimes you know, you may be having a tough day. You may be having you know, something serious happened in your life and seeing a shot that's going to crack you up is take you away for a second and from reality and you know, just lighten your mood a little bit and then you're able to get back into the day. Yeah, that's something I enjoy so I'm curious just kind of of changing topics here shortly. We mentioned in a previous conversation between you and I you know, our our love of Star Wars the Black Series that lined the a figures do you consider that to be your favorite line of figures to shoot or do you have another favorite line of action figures and you know, what is the reasoning behind that? I'm curious? Sure. I mean, I would probably I would have to say the Black Series line has been my favorite it kind of got me. Do it Star Wars is my favorite IP and there's there's there's so much content that you can shoot around in the Star Wars universe. So I've got a lot of those figures. I mean, I've got almost almost all of them got slowing down a little bit. But those those are just fun to shoot at the price point, you know, 20 bucks a pop. Sometimes you get them cheaper than that and you know, you find good deals. It makes it easy to kind of expand your collection. Even without like completely breaking the bank. I wouldn't be able to shoot just like strictly hot toys or 1/6 scale like some of these mazing other guys jobs to those that can right, right. Yeah. I am blown away. So the six-inch line the Black Series. I've got the most of that. So as a collector those are fun to shoot but you know over the years just being in the community and seeing other people. You know, what Love I mean, I know you you love all the mezco stuff. Like that's you know, the 112 you love you love that and so seeing guys like you shoot that stuff. It's inspiring because of being in the community. I'm was aware of it. I've got I've all I've got only got three of them. So I've got the Spider-Man homecoming Spider-Man The Wolverine the brown and yellow and then the Gomez and there they are incredible. Obviously, you know higher price point. But they are incredible figures so they are as much as I love just like the black serious stuff. And Marvel Legends, there's so many lines that are just they're inspiring and again, I don't like doing just one thing. And so if I'm in, you know, just shooting one line of toys. I get bored with that easily. So kind of branching out doing other things outside of Star Wars. I mean, I love Ninja Turtles growing up and I the the 1990 NECA stuff that they put out those figures are incredible. They're just like the Perfect sculpts and Recreations of the figures and I don't shoot them much but I have them and I love them because of what they kind of do for me in my Nostalgia and what I remember but you know again like the mezco stuff so highly articulate highly detailed I should say. Yeah that they just look amazing in shots. So I like variety but if you were going to say like what's you know, what's the thing? I collect most it would be definitely Star Wars Black Series stuff. Gotcha. So you're more of a 1/12 scale kind of guy versus the 1/6. I know you have a few hot toys. Yeah figures. So do you prefer to the shoot? The 112 versus 1/6, I would say yes, because a lot of it kind of logistically with having scaled, you know scaling up. Sometimes that could be more challenging than having more like diorama set pieces that are to 112 even if you need something like a little sofa or whatever might be like, there's like 112 like scale dollhouse accessories, you could buy or you go to the Hobby store and grab things. So sometimes it's easier to get that type of stuff and I'd say it's kind of the primary line that I collect one for price, but also kind of availability of Other like other props and things then also it's just it I feel like you can you can either go really tight and get some nice like medium or tight close-up shots of the figure at that scale or you can go really wide and see more of the scene when you go up to like 1/6. I feel like you're kind of in maybe a little bit tighter, but you're able to see more details and they look so good so but yeah one 112 is problem my go-to for sure. Nice nice me too, man. I love the 1/12 scale and I've kind of you know gone back and forth. And I tend to have a rabbit Trail mindset whenever I'm looking at figures or pre-orders and I'll get excited about a certain line and then I'll remember. Oh, yeah, there's this coming out to and it's as a collector. It's impossible to be able to keep up with every single line and every single series of characters and I think that's one of the more enjoyable aspects of the Photography Community is being able to see other people pick up figures that maybe you were interested in but you just didn't pick up because of budget constraints or whatever. It may be and then you see them doing those shots that you maybe you had in mind. I've seen that happen many times. I was like, oh I wanted to do that Shawn. I'm glad they did it and it's not like I'm jealous at all. I'm actually happy that they made the shot that I wanted to make and so I don't have to in my mind go out and purchase the figure because someone did it, right exactly. So it's It's funny to look at it from that aspect and enjoy photography as a community and as a creative collaboration. Yeah, it really is. It really is. Well, we're going to take a quick break and we will get right back to the toy photographers podcast. Stay right there. What's up, everybody? This is Dakota from Dagobah days with toy Federal cast.

Welcome back to the toy photographers podcast. This is the second part of the Jason. Yeah. Young interview get your cup of coffee ready? Because this is going to be an invigorating interview my friends Jason Young your back. Yes. I am in actually going to flip it around a little bit. So all right everybody welcome back to the toy photographers podcast. We were with Dakota Spicer. Welcome. Yo, yo, yo, what's up how much actually I was interested for some people they know that you're there go to Dagobah days customs and so Something we have been able to work on together, which has been a blast is a little project. You've been working on for the last few months, right? Yes, let you tell us a little about a little bit about what it is that we collaborated on together. Okay? Well, I'm gonna have to go back to the very beginning so man. I was working at a factory couple years ago and was just kind of I saw this post and my friend and you know, she's like an Little person and was like, you know, if you want to like move on with your life like you really just need a dream yourself out of the old season and into the new I know that super-spiritual maybe people who aren't like into spirituality whatever. I'm just like, you know, just ignore this segment, but I was like, okay, how do I do that? Practically speaking? How do I dream myself out of my old season and into a new season, so I was like, okay. I love toy photography. I love action figures. I love dioramas boys. Wanted to make dioramas and I Just grew up in a very creative household always creating always making things by hand and I love Star Wars 2. So I just kind of started just daydreaming while I was working at this Factory and I was like, what could I make, you know, maybe be cool to make a Star Wars, you know diorama that people could you know, not only recreate certain scenes but use as you know multifaceted experience to be able all to you know, create scenes like with the black series figures are figure arts. And at this at this real quick at this point, you've already kind of been a part of like the community so you'd see yet people doing tweet ography and probably building dioramas as well. Right I had and I was you know, at the time I was not as involved in the toy photography aspect. I was more in the to the creative aspect of creating things and so it kind of you know, Goes back and forth and that process and so what I did is I had reached out to you and I think I've reached out to a couple other people. I've just kind of picking their brains about you know, how do I do this? If I want to do this? What do I do? And you had hooked me up with was figure works and he let me just say is the most incredible dude hands down really it is such an incredible guy. So humble so approachable and I just reached out to him. I was like dude I have this idea. I want to make a diorama that's based off of you know, the Cantina scene in A New Hope and he was like, okay. Well, this is what you have to do and you just started laying out all the framework and you know, you know, long story short. We basically started brainstorming and we had we had a product that we could be able to create and so he gave me the scene specific dimensions for for the scene and I was so grateful because he All of this knowledge and I was able to just take that knowledge and be able to create and you know, I went through a couple of different processes and creating there's different versions that we made along the way and we came up with this modular version of the Smugglers or treat man. It's just it was so much fun to be able to do that process and now so moving into the process of actually pre-orders and everything sure that was that was a learning process. Is that was annexed random that was extremely fun. But also taxing learning process because I had to just be glued to my phone for every DM and every single, you know opportunity to respond to customers potential customers. And you know, I'm I was learning I was you know, learning the process of how to be able to be an independent diorama maker. And yeah, so so if I may I would say the other the other thing about that is that when you started and we started you know you You sent one to me. We started shooting it along with a couple other guys and really it kind of opened our minds up with it being modular and kind of creating these different scenes taking those shots giving them back to you and it helped you have things to actually put forth important to come in the community and say hey building this together kind of collaborative, you know with with all of us and people could see what they could do with it. And I think maybe part of it was like maybe the ation in everything you created was such a high quality. I'm not saying like toy photography just the piece that you created such a high quality that people responded so well to that. I think I mean you it sounded like you got quite a few people who actually purchased and who were just really excited you get reposted several places. And so you just from the beginning you were making a solid product and doing that, you know, and it's Thinking, you know the collaborative way that was that was pretty cool to see and be you know, honestly be a part of I was I'm so grateful for the opportunity to be able to work with you guys and the C3 Bros and being able to send you guys those prototypes and you guys gave me some great feedback and I was able to adjust in like some of the things that you had mentioned like for instance the in inside wall. I had left unfinished on your guys dioramas. And so you're like, hey, it'd be a lot better if you went. It back in and just kind of made the whole thing, you know have that texture in that field. So that way you could have more opportunity for different shots. And so that was a great feedback, you know learning from my mistakes learning from little things and I make all these by hand. I don't have any instruments like that are writing and everything's by hand. So it's a one-of-a-kind exactly. Each one is unique. Each one is painstakingly created and crafted for each customer. And so going to the do the I said the pre-orders, you know, I didn't realize when I took on this project how I was going to really do it, you know, and that's kind of my I wouldn't necessarily call it a method but it's kind of my way with all of the things that I do I just jump in and I figure it out along the way you don't have to really know everything to know to be able to do something and you know people are willing to work with you when they know that you're learning and you're approachable and so my customers, you know. I'm still I'm still crafting orders instead of still shipping out orders. You know it originally I was slated. I wanted to finish the entire project by summer, but it's kind of I've had some family issues come up and it's pushed back by its pushed back a lot of orders and you know being so involved in my family and my wife's mother actually got cervical cancer and that really, you know, kind of basically halted a lot of production because she moved in with us and we were you know, Care of her and so not to get too heavy but just draft process alone for like learning it is and learning how to manage and juggle all of the orders along side of doing a all my other things that I'm doing, you know, it's definitely been a process, but I'm so glad that I never gave up and I never I never threw in the towel because at some points it really was stressful because I want I want I can hold myself to a very high standard and I think it comes from my upbringing. Me and my family and I have you know, my grandfather was in sports journalism for 20 years and he's just a master at speaking and and someone that's very influential in his craft and I hold myself to a very high standard because of because of his influence in my life and all these other aspects of my history my family history. So when I whenever I don't feel like I'm you know performing and creating at my best, you know, I get very stressed. So it's been it's been a learning process has been a you know, there's for instance like even the little metal bars that go behind Han Solo's head when he's sitting on that scene. Yeah, you know I had no idea how I was going to do that whenever I put the actual pre-order process up and I didn't actually have that because I remember I had done a different version of it. Would I what I had done was using wood wooden dowel rods right? And those were you know, they were worth They were but they were the nice to upgrade what you figured out like all those little details that you added and then some of the 3D printed pieces that you worked with bigger works on like it just again like you're talking about you continue to push yourself and elevate your craft. Listen to feedback and ultimately all that does is just kind of like with the community ultimately we're building each other up and you can see the difference from where you started and where you are now and I imagine Your heads going for the next thing, you know, I can see that you're just always paying attention to those details and winning just improve things. And so that's that's another reason why I think even though all these things, you know life happens to all of us it does. You've always been really good at communicating with your obviously the clients but also the community to like, hey, I'm working on this stuff, you know, kind of got behind on some things just telling people like hey, I've got to put this off for a little bit. If you're if you're just communicating and letting people know and being cool about stuff you get a lot of Grace back and I know that's probably stressful for you as well to feeling like oh no, I've gotta tell everybody that I've got a delay it by a little bit a little bit but I think we all understand that life is the first thing we got to do and then we do this kind of for fun and enjoyment, but I've always appreciated about about you that you you genuinely care about people you care about providing. You know a great product and great service. And yeah, I think that's another reason why you are also a great pillar of this community as well. And thank you so much. Do you I really appreciate that. It doesn't always feel that way and you know, our minds can sometimes be you know, the worst down worst of critics. And so I appreciate you saying those things. It's something that I love to do and when I'm doing it when I'm creating those dioramas I get such Joy. And I know that when that person gets that diorama and they, you know are able to create or maybe you know, some of the people that have gotten these dioramas just strictly use it for display and that's great. That's true. And it's something that I just have a deep appreciation for all of my customers and I want to make sure that they feel taken care of and you know, they're appreciated and you know anybody that wants to get anything personally designed and made by me. Your figure works, you know, we take it seriously, you know, we really do it. It's an investment. You knows. It's an investment and you know, it's not something that it's not something that we want to you know, just put out product. It's not enjoyable because I want to enjoy it if I'm enjoying it and I feel like maybe someone else will enjoy it. So definitely definitely well. It's like I said it is so fun to work with you and I know there's some other things that you're working on I think so anything that were able to kind of collaborate. On in the future is always just a blast. So I'm excited. I'm definitely a proponent for you and everything you're doing for the community. Thank you, man. Thank you. Yeah, I will give a little teaser. If you're if you're give if you're a fan of Han Solo and you like the Star Wars the Black Series stuff look out next year pending everything gets finished with the Smugglers Retreats. I want to open up a pre-order hopefully in February and it's going to be Turn the Jedi theme so I'm not going to get any more specific. He's like NW something. Yeah Return of the Jedi Han Solo. So you might understand what I'm saying? Okay, okay, but and then I'm also get that one an eye on ice for a little bit. Yes. We'll put that one on ice. And I also I want to do a batman-themed diorama like a big project and it's going to be limited. So I'm you know, when I started out to smuggle to treat I just kind of opened up, you know. Oh infinite amount of pre-orders. I got 25 orders of the Smugglers Retreat. So I was very blessed to have those many orders, but I didn't realize you know, like I said the amount of time it would take to do those. So I'm going to do a limited run of both the the next to pre-order so it'll probably be anywhere between 10 and 20 awesome. So you'll come with us. We'll keep us posted probably here to have stalkers podcast toy photo cast, but then also like dig of the day is taken It's Customs, make sure and keep us updated right I will keep everyone updated there will be plenty of time to preorder. I will probably have a two-month window to pre-order. So that way everybody can get the funds necessary to be able to place a pre-order. Nice. Can't wait to see it. It's going to be amazing. I can already tell so thank you man. Thank you. I'm excited. It's going to be fun. So I'm going to go ahead and switch the mic back around. So now we are going to finish our our incredible interview with mr. Jason Young. Hey, how's it going for talking about podcast? Hey, it's good to have you back. Hello. I have a question for you, sir. I asked the amazing this and that episode has yet to be released but I asked him this and I wanted to ask you this as well because our curious do you see yourself as an influencer? And how does it really affect you, you know being an artist with that big a following on Instagram. Do you see yourself as that? Is that something that you were constantly aware of if we're talking about influencing? I mean, I guess there's different ways you could could could approach that. You sure strictly speaking. I mean, I think there have been a few times when people will send me DMS and say what do you think about that like the hyper-real Vader and I might talk to them or or they might send me a had a couple people who sent me messages that okay. I'm I was on the fence, but now that you, you know, did the unboxing video you took some photos and I can actually see with my eyes how things could could be if it's you know with with them they can kind of Envision it you you Me over and I'm definitely going to buy that so there's been a few times when I know specifically people have his said okay, if you if you love that that figure if you love that died or whatever it is then I trust you and I'm going to do it or hey tell me about those lights that you got that you've used for the you know, the last setup or grass mats or whatever people might reach out and I can say oh you should hear I got him here then a couple minutes later. Alright, I just purchased them. So from a from like a strictly like it. Influencer doing what you're supposed to do to get people to buy product. Maybe I that's happened a few times but I do the same thing with anybody who who has something that's interesting and I can say oh man, that would make my process better or make my shots better and I think in a sense everybody's kind of an influencer, it's always hard because obviously I've got I've had a good relationship with Hasbro and you know some other some other companies and like your toy link and Towering toys and you know some other people that I've been working with over the years that it's just had good relationships with and so from an outside perspective people might say, oh, well, he's working with these companies and getting product to shoot and all that stuff. And I mean, yeah, that's that's cool. I don't know if that makes people say like, oh, hey, he's he's a real influencer. He's a social-media influencer. My wife actually will kid me about that. I will she yeah, like she yeah. Hey, this is this is my husband. He's a social media and like stop she's proud of you and so funny she is and I love her. Yeah, I mean maybe from accent but again, I just love I'll kind of go back to it. I just love being able to share techniques. I'm using products I'm using you know, and also be honest, so even there's some stuff that I might get like, yeah, I don't really doesn't really do much for me or this thing. Immediately out of the box and I'll be honest with people. So who knows, you know, it's interesting that you look at it that way because you know, there's so many people that do look at people like yourself and other people whenever they get the products and from Hasbro or from whom whomever, you know, they do really take your opinion seriously because you're able to get those hands on reviews and I know like I mentioned DM azinger Earlier, you know people really take seriously his thoughts on a figure. Yeah and reviews are awesome, man. They're so good. And you know, it's so funny about him is you know, he only reviews the things that he really enjoys and then something that you can kind of, you know, tell whenever he's doing a review and he focuses on the good, you know more than the things that he doesn't enjoy being I guess when I say influence her I don't necessarily mean that in a negative connotation because a lot of people I guess see being an influencer as someone that just kind of pushes their opinion on everybody and that's not what I'm saying. I'm okay. Yeah. Well when I say an influencer, I mean someone that is a positive force of spreading basically your thoughts on specific subjects and people taking those and of course you're going to make a decision whether or not you want to purchase something on your own or what are you know, even from a creative aspect you are influencing people creatively, you know through the way 1812 the Tog Rafi and you're behind the scenes. So from from here on now anybody is listening this when I say influencer, I mean that as a good thing, I don't mean that as an egg as a negative thing. Maybe it's gotten a bad rap. Yeah, it's possible. I mean but yes, I would like to think I just love I love people. I love talking know I love engaging with people and so I think just with where we are in society. It's so easy to jump on and hide behind social media and Really say what you want and be ugly and man it just we need to not do that. I think that's what's so enticing about this community is that we're more I would say we're more positive than we are negative. I hope that when people reach out and they send me messages and have conversations with people. I hope people get that. I don't ever want to come across as you know anything other than hey, I'm just like you as a matter like like, you know, there's always going to be people who have a better bigger following or more more like sand. More, you know more relationships or whatever. It is. Like it doesn't really matter. I just hope people just recognize that I'm just part of the community is everybody else's so exactly and there's no like Instagram royalty out there. I mean, of course people like people like to consider followers as something to base a specific type of following. You know, what I'm trying to say is it doesn't matter. It really doesn't and you know people in this community I mentioned this before on the previous podcast, you know, if followings they happen as you progress, you know, as your content gets better and more refined you of course that just happens. Yeah, it's just a part of something you can't control, you know on Instagram, especially with today's algorithm and the way that it's regulated and you know, basically it's a money pit if you want to spend lots of money, you could get tons of followers, you know, but it's not worth it. It's not worth stressing about all that stuff. Anyway l so it's not over stressing it at all, and I'm Just glad that you do see yourself as someone that you know is able to make positive reinforcing opinions and being able to really encourage and craft a community that's going to be potentially could last for a very long time. I hope it does I think so, I think so. Do you have any wins like when I say wins, do you have any like big moments that you look back on your on your journey as a toy? Or do you have any moments that you look back and say wow, I just got to pinch myself real quick. Did that actually happen? I would say the biggest one and obviously because I'm such a Star Wars fan, you know every well they pretty much have done for the last few years kind of open submissions for the Star Wars Fan Awards. Yes, and so it's funny. I had an idea to basically recreate instead of just like toy targeting recreate almost like a kid. Ed star like a Kinder old retro kiner TV commercial. Yeah and use the use the products and kind of feature those to make a long story short, you know created like a little 12 second spot, you know narrated it and I actually was taking the figures with my hands and moving the characters around the scene and kind of intentionally trying to be like kind of tongue-in-cheek with it had driveways record some audio for the characters and really I took like about a day or two out of my actual work day to day. I do it because I was just so excited about what it could be and you know, put all my client work aside good or bad and created this little piece and ended up submitting It For The Fan Awards and I won for the best or a fan. I forget exactly what it was. But basically one for that that category it's so short short video. And again, it was is interesting because I submitted it and then waited a few months and then they said hey you're you know, all your part of the The the voting and then voting went on for a while and then waited a few more months and then got a notification like hey, you actually won but if wait a couple months before we actually announced it and you know make this little video and then we'll kind of put it all together. So it's funny because it would it felt like it was like maybe over the course of like six months when I created the video and then once it was announced so I kept kind of forgetting that I made it in submitted it. Was you know part of the kind of the group of winners in an actually announce that I won and so every time it's kind of like it's a little pinch like, oh my gosh Star Wars Star Wars.com. Like I'm I know it was that was pretty wild and what what I really appreciate about that is that it it really is Testament to kind of bringing together what I do full-time as invisible element, but the also my hobby and my love and my passion for photography and And also Star Wars is just kind of an IP and it all kind of was represented me and the toys and then bringing my kids into it to help, you know with family and it kind of was just like a really great piece that represented who who I am and to be able to win that along with several of my other friends who won awards in their own categories like this. Just I still kind of look back and kind of incredible. So that was probably my biggest win so far since assuming doing Been so for people that want to see that video. How can they access the let's see if you okay. So I've got on my website. I believe I've got a link and I'll go check and make sure it's there but on my website work more or less.com, I think in the about section you can go to there's some links down at the bottom. And from there you should be able to pull it up. But yeah, I need to also update my side a little bit but But should be able to see it there or if you screw you want to scroll on my my feed on Instagram. You can see it there as well. It's it's down there kind of buried a legit. But yeah, that was pretty cool and saw silly. That is an I gotta it's so cool work too. So you got a trophy. Yeah. Wow, so, you know being massive Star Wars fans that you and I are it's kind of interesting that Star Wars has you know Stickley celebrated the fans in this way and it's nothing more than just, you know saying we are appreciative of you and that's what Star Wars I feel like, you know, I wasn't jealous at all because I didn't even if you know put a submission and I was so happy that you got that award and you know, the other people in the community that one I think Zay one and Trevor one and you know, I can't remember there was a couple other people was there any more in the toy community that that that won an award? Yeah, there were I think Chesapeake's TK triple six. I'm tall gosh. Yeah, there were a few other people. Yeah, specifically what's his name shooting the Galaxy didn't he win one? Let's see. I'm trying to remember Matthew did thank you did too. Yeah, it's been a while. It's been a while. Yeah, a lot of people submitted and even were part of even if they didn't win they were still Part of the voting and so we had a lot of people who submitted photos and were even just part of the voting round. And so that was a huge win for our community as well and just bringing that into the light. So it's so cool man. So like kind of transitioning from Star Wars celebrating, you know, that sort of fandom, you know, I I love to you know pick the brains of everybody that comes on the show. Like, what do you think? Us as a community as a toy photography and toy photographer specific Community. What do you think we need to focus on how can we just be a better Community? How can we practically speaking? You know, just bring this community up to the level that maybe maybe it's not at yet. What do you think? Well, I do think we're off to a really great start. I think like I said in general least the people on run around with I feel like everybody's is pretty respectful when I mean, I know that we still need to make sure we're you know crediting each other for reposting stuff or if we've got if you've seen something in your inspired by it, you know just saying hey I saw this and I wanted to recreate it and you know credit the artist, you know, that's just things that I think we should do just in general, but I think the the biggest thing is just interacting interacting in encouraging and lifting one another up because it's such a great place. To start off in and I think we can just continue to do more of that and not worry so much about what what you're creating and if it's something that you came up with or you're using a new technique or whatever it is, but just people really respond well to just open open dialogue and being able to share and it's amazing to see I think it's kind of a testament to the community. Are just like from when we when I started like in 2016 to now the quality has gone up significant exponentially. So anybody starting off now? I think you guys talked about this and previous podcast somebody who's starting off now can already has like a huge understanding wealth of Knowledge from people who have come before exact kind of the same way. And so, you know people people share people are not and trying to keep you know, the cards. Close to their chest but they're sharing and sharing behind-the-scenes content and setups. And this is the the types of tools that I use and this is how I go about it. And I think that's just kind of in itself. That is that's just something that's that's really built the community and made it such a great one to be a part of it really is and you know, when you mentioned the shoutouts, I love it whenever somebody on the Dagobah Customs page Will shout out me as Inspiration for their their build and they'll tag me in it or they'll comment and I'll say this was you know inspired by dig of a customs and that to me is the biggest compliment. I'm like, first of all I got to give credit to George Lucas. I didn't make this stuff like, you know, I didn't, you know create this from just out of nothing. I definitely we all aren't we all come from, you know people that are interested in fandom. Yeah, and I'm going to some degree and you know, you got to go Credit where credit is due, you know, it's so true and just being able to say you inspired me that goes a long way. So when you're able to just say hey, this shot was inspired by so and so and exactly when you do that you then like you said you create dialogue you able to you know communicate with one another and in able to gives that person those warm fuzzies, you know, and it's a good feeling. It's a good feeling to say. Oh, wow that guy really inspired that person and one of my favorite shots that I've done. You know people like to people have said this before that Daredevil shot I had done in my page. Oh, yeah, people will sit there and say that's my favorite shot, you know or just in general and I'm always blown away because I really didn't put too much into that shot. It was just a simple shot and just knowing that it affects people in that way it really it's a it means a lot. It really does. Yeah, I agree. I agree with you and that is a great shot. By the way. Thank you. Man, thank you. I I love that show. I really do. I really love the Daredevil. I hope they come back for another season, but they will once we get the streaming going hashtag save Daredevil, I like it comes back. I hope it does. So what is your views man? Do you have any like methodology on healthy living or exercise? Do you have like a pretty strict schedule on how you kind of keep up your mental Fitness? And how do you kind of use? You I know toy photography. It really does affect or photography. But how do you view yourself as a human? Like, what do you do in your routine? I think like over anything because it's easy to say. Oh, well, I need to be eating better. I need to be working out. I don't have like a workout routine. I don't do that as much as I should I mean for me, I think for the most important thing you can do is just be mentally healthy. So there's always things you Can improve upon yourself like physically just routine stuff like that, but if mentally you're you're struggling with things and you don't have a space where you can just kind of disengage and just kind of reset like that's that's kind of to me. I think that's the most important thing and you know, obviously what toy photography has become for me is kind of that space where I can just say, okay. I know I've got all these projects that are do I know there's stuff going on. Our family that you know, I need to focus or get accomplished or we've got all these, you know events that are happening. There's all this stuff going around on in our lives, but toy photography allows me the space to step back kind of reset just get my mind off of things that I can be stressed about and for me that honestly over the last few years has made me feel like a little just a little bit more level out because it's so easy to to look at life and look at all the things you need to be doing or the need you need to accomplish and sometimes that list. It just keeps growing right even if you check something off, you've got like five other things that are taking its place and so it's not like doing certain regiments are going to actually solve all those problems. It's just going to keep happening and new things are going to come up that you're gonna have to deal with but you need that any that mental time and that mental space where you can just kind of disengage even if it's just for you know, 30 minutes or whatever it is. It's super important and that's kind of it's funny how that's what toy photographies become and that's provided me kind of the ability to kind of just mentally feel healthy that maybe you can it does and you can definitely feel that whenever you post a shot because any time you upload any content. I always feel refreshed and so because you're coming from that perspective and you're viewing this as a A positive refreshing Outlook and being able to you know, just kind of create something that's going to inspire and encourage and I always take away from your shot. So I'm like man. I just I feel good. You know what? I mean? It's a good feeling and it definitely shows in your content. So that's amazing. That's so cool shit that that right. There is like one of the highest compliments. I mean just that's what I want. When I do this, I want it to be just an extension of how I feel how my passion and love it. For this is so hearing you say that that means a lot. Appreciate it. Welcome in. You're welcome. Do you have any tips for people that are just starting out doing toy photography that you kind of like looking back maybe had you done this you would have either enjoyed it more or maybe progressed faster. Do you have any tips? I mean, I know the other guys from the other episodes have provided some other really great tips, but I'd say just kind of off the top of my head don't be scared to to connect with people. Don't be scared to send people messages and just a straight up ask them. Hey, how did you do this or what are your camera settings? Because again people generally are more flattered by that. Like that's a cool shot. How did you do that? So being just stepping out and saying, okay. I want to I want to ask these people questions don't look at anybody is like some kind of legend or whatever. We're all people. So we've got numbers on our on our Counts. We got followers. We have likes whatever but we're all just wrong in it together. So just Reach Out Beyond its ask questions. The the worst thing you can do is not do anything. So if you want to get into it, you want to try it don't let anything hold you back like, oh, I really need a nice camera or I can't shoot with my with my phone justjust do it. And you know, if you kind of start getting that routine you can Figure out like okay. I really love doing this and let's just take the time and start growing your your tool set, you know upgrading cameras upgrading your process. Whatever it is. Just just take that first step in even when I go back and look at my old stuff like, oh, it's okay I could do way better now because I've taken those steps and I'm I am to the point where I've had a little bit more experience and it's understood, you know different techniques and I've Little bit more knowledge. So if I tackled that again now with the three years experience or I could do it better, but it's cool to go back and look at where you started and how far you've come. So even if you feel like you're going to start in your photos going to look terrible. It's still a cool part of the journey going back and looking at where you started and how much you've improved. Let's see what else you know, nothing. I know everyone has mentioned like you got to be passionate about it like if you if you You don't love what you're shooting. Don't shoot it. That's a waste of your time. Don't just get something because somebody else made it look amazing and you want to recreate it. Like if whatever it is, you're you love and whatever you have in your house. If you're collecting things, it's pops or Black Series figures or pop toys or anything. If it's McDonald's toys, it doesn't matter if you're passionate about something let that be what you focus on and then everything. Your creativity will be will come from that. So don't try to like say oh, I want to be a really great one 6 photographer. If you're not passionate about it, then this not worth it. So do what you do what you love and everything will kind of come from your national natural inclinations and passions. That is an amazing tip man. I I really can say that I have transitioned into that kind of mindset over time because I really struggled you know with the Keeping up with the Joneses attitude when I first started toy photography because you know, you see all these figures that everybody's getting and you want to jump in the bandwagon and feel like you're in with the crowd and it you know, like you said is like if you don't enjoy it if you don't find this enjoyable, if you're just doing it to just fit in like man, just take a step back, you know, right feel like okay. This is really something that I enjoy and you know, like like you'd mentioned earlier, you know in the previous segment. I love the mezco. Yours and you know, not all the mezco figures are for me. You know, I really don't like horror figures like I If you insane way follow 112 Collective, I really shy away from reposting anything. That's the slightest bit scary because I just don't enjoy it. So yeah, you know, I don't have any sort of hatred towards people that do enjoy it. I just don't enjoy personally so, you know every once in a while sneaking a Freddy vs. Jason just you know, For the people out there. They're like man. Why don't you share my you know, Friday the 13th shot and I'm like, okay. Well, I'm just in a wink I'm going to you know wince through this but like you said like just enjoying toy photography finding things that from your childhood that you loved and being able to incorporate that because so many action for your companies now are producing figures on at such a premium and affordable way to be able to do for toy photography and it really does seem like The companies are producing it specifically for toy photography. I have a toy photographers. It's no longer, you know, the collectors out there who are kind of dominating the market, it's me. It's the toy photographers and it's the people out there who want the articulation and the companies are responding and they are able to say, how can we make this able to be photographed better? How can we make this, you know able to look more realistic and that's such a enjoyable. Nothing, too. So if you're not out there and maybe you don't know what you like. Maybe just I recommend you know, like Jason said pick up a black series figure pick up a Marvel Legends figure go out there. They're affordable 20 bucks. Just go out there. Pick one up pick up a Spider-Man figure pick up a Batman figure and just kind of try. Try it out. And if you if you don't enjoy it, then you can know instead of investing in a hot toys and saying I really don't enjoy this, you know, yeah, right and then trying to recoup that money is difficult, especially With hot toys yeah, no kidding. So yeah, man, that's an incredible tip and I just want to just kind of close it out here man, and just say thank you so much for coming on the episode. It's been an amazing amazing episode. I know so many people are going to gain so much from this conversation. And so many people are going to be able to use this as a resource. So just thank you ma'am.

We look at you all the time and feel very bonded to you. It is an honor and a pleasure to support each other in our scripture Journey Together Scott. Once I was commissioned to write a series of films on the Book of Mormon. And as I was planning them the spirit kept nagging me that I was missing something really important then one day as I was searching these very chapters that we are studying today. I saw what it was I had not focused on the The importance of the Covenant and therefore had missed something Central to my understanding of the Book of Mormon. Of course, we know from the title page of the Book of Mormon that one of its purposes is that the remnant of the House of Israel may know the covenants of the Lord and that though this little branch of the Covenant people have now come to a Faraway place. They are not cast off forever being part of the Covenant is Central to their identity their relationship to God their sense of security. And their story they trust that as the Lord says in Psalm 105 verse 8, he hath remembered his Covenant forever the word which he commanded to a thousand Generations, which means of course longer than forever yet. I see Covenant stories and moments in the Book of Mormon pass Us by in Sunday schools as if this Central purpose of the scripture is invisible. So let's start by looking at what Lehigh says when they have arrived to the the promised land first. He says for behold. I have seen a vision in which I know that Jerusalem is destroyed and had we remained in Jerusalem. We should have also perished. Remember Jerusalem was sacked around 587 or 586 BC then immediately Lehigh rejoices, but said, he notwithstanding our afflictions. We have obtained a land of promise a land which is Choice above all other lands a Which the Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Ye the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me and to my children forever and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord. This is an interesting phrase a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me. Let's back up a bit and talk more about the nature of the Covenant. We talked about the Old Testament and the the New Testament but in reality the word test a momentum in Latin means Covenant, it has the meaning of an inheritance and a witness. So the Old Testament is actually the old Covenant and the New Testament is the New Covenant the purpose of the Book of Mormon from the title page is to show unto the remnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers and that they may know the covenants of the Lord. Of course, the word covenant is in the very title of the Doctrine and Covenants. So we understand what this very central theme of the scriptures is it is teaching about the Covenant its nature its promises what happens when it is capped what happens when it is broken sacred history is about the Covenant. It is the very tool for opening and understanding the scriptures more deeply and the Covenant can only be made because cuz of the atonement of Jesus Christ people ask us all the time how they can understand scripture better see it through the lens of the Covenant who is God. He has many attributes, but foremost he is a covenant maker because that is the means powered by the atonement of saving his children from a fallen world and from their own Fallen Nature's which when you get down to it as what hurts us the most A covenant is a legal agreement. It is a contract it is a will that says you will be joint heirs with Christ, which means ultimately you inherit his nature. It is security for us on Earth. God sets the terms but most of the performance is on his part the atonement the gift of the Holy Ghost the guidance the support the patients with us when we falter the strength, he lends us. He day he asks us to do very little for him to do his work. But give a broken heart and a contrite spirit our place and keeping our covenant is a desire a willingness a seeking to obey it is not that we can give Perfection right now the Lord understands the difficulty of our journey and mortality and unless we willfully rebel against our covenants. He works long and patiently with us. He tells us that his gifts and Covenants are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my Commandments and him that seeketh. So to do oh, I love that seeketh. So to do phrase in that verse that certainly gives me hope so what are the Covenant blessings? We like to think of them as six peas so that it's easy to remember you can particularly see these when God gives the Covenant to Abraham the first p Is protection his Covenant people are protected as a nation if they will keep the Commandments. You see so many stories illustrating this in the Old Testament. Syria is warring against Israel the northern kingdom and they far outnumber the Israelites when the city was compassed all about by a great enemy host. The servant of the man of God was risen early saw the terrifying sight and said to the Prophet Elijah alas my master how shall we do? And Elisha prayed and said Lord. I pray thee open his eyes that he may see when his eyes were opened. He saw a mountain full of heavenly horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elijah. That's how the Lord protects his faithful Covenant children. The next p of the Covenant is posterity whose importance is clear in scripture. You see the great concern of the Book of Mormon prophets for what will happen to their posterity. And then the next p is priesthood the Covenant is administered and maintained by the priesthood power of God. Any other power will ultimately falter. The fourth p is prosperity. This does not necessarily mean material Prosperity but is instead the sense that the Lord will prosper your way with his presence. That is why Nephi could say with such confidence when asked to do hard things. I will go and do the things which the Lord Hath commanded for I know that the lord giveth no Commandments unto the children of men save. He shall prepare a way for them that preparing a way through his spirit is prospering v p is presence the end of the Covenant journey is to be brought into the Lord's presence. That means that he has schooled us and groomed us and pruned us to inherit eternal life. John Taylor said through the world's great. Their father they discovered a plan fraught with intelligence and wisdom reaching from eternity to Eternity pointing out a means, whereby through obedience to Celestial laws. They might obtain the same power that he had and if in Fallen Humanity, they might have to suffer for a while. They saw a way back to God to Eternal exaltations and to the multiplied and eternally increasing happiness of innumerable me. Millions of beings and if as Jesus they had to descend below all things. It was that they might be raised above all things and take their positions as Sons and Daughters of God in the Eternal world. That's the P of presence a joint heir of Christ because we have his nature. So the Covenant includes protection posterity priesthood power prosperity and God's presence. It's the one we have left out. The vi p-- is Promised Land. Abraham was promised it Moses was promised it and we see in these first verses of second Nephi that Lehigh obtains a Promised Land. He understands. This is a covenant blessing it is this Covenant awareness that ties The Book of Mormon to the Old Testament and the place from which Lehi and his family came. What is so important about this gift is it means to have a place we find this idea when we say blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the Earth or when Christ says I go to prepare a place for you. Is there a satyr word in the language than homeless or a satyr people than refugees who have no place the Sheikh of the desert which Lehigh was will say to those he takes into his tent Ilan wassailing wahab on which means a family Smooth place a wide place you have place with us. That's essentially what Lehigh would have said to zoram as they took him in. It is a covenant phrase Lehigh says wherefore this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring and if it so be that they shall serve him according to the Commandments which he hath given it shall be a land of liberty unto them wherefore they shall never be brought down into captivity. Then he spells out what those blessings look like in this much as Those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his Commandments. They shall prosper upon the face of this land and they shall be kept from all other nations that they may possess this land unto themselves. And if it so be that they shall keep his Commandments. They shall be blessed upon the face of this land and there shall be none to molest them nor to take away the land of their inheritance and they Shall dwell safely forever because this is a land for a covenant people as long as they keep the Commandments. They shall prosper and be kept from harm by any who would molest them. It is clear. There are Covenant blessings astounding blessings. We call them Baraka barakatuh means Covenant power efficacy and blessing in Egypt. They have a brand of water called Baraka and what could be a greater relief in the Desert than water. I love that bought a car when we're in Egypt yet. These Covenant blessings are conditional on are keeping our part of the promise. We must obey the Commandments What happens when we don't when we are willfully rebellious. It is called a covenant cursing and the word for that is gah. Lah, you like to say that don't you Scott? There's a kind of ring to it. Yes. Gallalala. Gallalala. It does sound like a cursing. So here is the Covenant cursing or Might call it the consequence for willfully breaking the Covenant. It is a warning upon the promised land and this is what Lehigh says but behold when the time comes that they shall dwell in DeLand unbelief after they have received so great blessings from the hand of the Lord having a knowledge of the creation of the earth and all men knowing the great and marvelous works of the Lord from the creation of the world having power given them to do all things by faith having all the Commandments from the inning and having been brought by his infinite goodness into this precious land of promise behold. I say if the day shall come that they will reject the Holy One of Israel the true Messiah the Redeemer and their God behold the judgments of him that is just shall rest upon them. The Covenant is conditional upon obedience. This doesn't mean that if we work with all our heart to keep our covenants, but our flawed human beings repenting and trying again. that we are breaking our covenants breaking the Covenant is about willful rebellion, and then consequences follow it is because the Lord then withdraws his spirit and people are left to the ravages and buffetings of Satan to make this point clear when the children of Israel that Moses LED out of Egypt came into the promised land six tribes stood on Mount gerizim and six on neighboring mount a ball those who stood on Mount gerizim were to call out the Covenant blessings and those on Mount a ball the series of curses that would follow Disobedience the blessings as all Covenant blessings are were powerful blessed shalt thou be in the city and blessed shalt thou be in the field blessed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground and the fruit of thy cattle the increase of by kind and the flocks of thy sheep blessed shall be thy basket and I store blessed. Shalt thou be when thou comest in and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out the Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face Thou shalt come out against the one way and flee before these seven ways the Lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy store houses and in all that thou settest thine hand onto and he shall bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. It goes on and on the blessings that we are most in need of to have a secure and happy mortal experience, but these promises would slip away and be revoked if the people became rebellious and worshiped other gods as we know I the Lord am bound when you do what I say, but when you do not what I say, you have no promise this Covenant on the promised land is mentioned constantly in the Book of Mormon. Someone has calculated 38 times. You can't miss this theme more than that it also So lets us see the why of what happens in this book more clearly. The nephite nation is decimated because they utterly turn from the Covenant. But if that is not enough to demonstrate what happens when a people turned from the Lord we get the story twice. We also learned of the Jared I to turn from their covenants and were also destroyed the Book of Mormon has been called a witness and a warning the witness, of course is the Divinity and the atonement of Jesus Christ. Christ the warning is of prophets who passionately plead with us not to turn our backs on God and His covenants The Book of Mormon insists that the calamities and warnings. It describes our for our day Maroney is Frank Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me and I know you're doing it might be jarring to think that a prophet who has seen our day delivers a book to us. That doesn't just give us sweet platitudes about the importance of being good. But also spells with such muscle the tactics and smooth talk of Satan as he Woo's a covenant people from their lord knowing all this Lehigh pleads with Laman and Lemuel. Oh that ye would awake awake from a deep sleep. Yay Ethan from the sleep of hell and shake off the awful change by which you are bound which are the chains which bind the children of men that they are carried away captive down to the Eternal Gulf of Misery and woe chains and deep sleep are very powerful images depicting what Satan does to those who had been promised so much now Lehigh, of course is nearing the end of his life and will give blessings to his worthy sons in his first words to Jacob Lehigh reveals. Another Covenant promise acknowledging that Jacob has had a rough time, especially because of the rudeness of his brothers Lehigh said the Lord She'll consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain. What a critical piece of knowledge. This is sometimes it seems that our suffering is random on this Earth and many think that life itself is just suffering this Covenant Assurance is that the suffering we face has a purpose it is for our development and growth and goodness understanding the purpose for suffering and opposition and turning to the Lord for Comfort can utterly transform. Our afflictions president Allen a chokes said the Apostle Paul taught that the Lord's teachings and teachers were given that we may all attain the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. This process requires far more than acquiring knowledge. It is not even enough for us to be convinced of the Gospel we must act and think so that we are converted by it in contrast to the institutions of the world which teach us to know something. The Gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to become something other scriptures in large Upon This by referring to are being judged by the condition we have achieved that's a powerful word the condition we've achieved sometimes I think we imagine that we will stand before the Judgment bar and roll out a list of the things we have achieved a sort of resume of Earth are busy task list. That won't be necessary for the Lord will look at what we are and who we have become our being will be transparent strong solid and clear before him Preston Oak said a parable illustrates this understanding a wealthy father knew that if he were to bestow his wealth Upon a Child who had not yet developed the needed wisdom and stature The Inheritance would probably be wasted the father said to his child all that. I have I desired to give you not only my wealth but also my position and standing Man that which I have I can easily give you but that which I am you must obtain for yourself, you will qualify for your inheritance by learning what I have learned and by living as I have lived, lehi's blessing to Jacob is a reflection of the man Jacob had both seen the Lord and had great Affliction. Thusly High tells the creation story to him in a different way than it is expressed in Genesis or a Abraham here the emphasis is on the need for choice in the face of opposition painting a vivid picture of our mortal experience Lehigh explains. It must needs be that there is an opposition in all things. If not, so righteousness could not be brought to pass neither wickedness neither Holiness nor misery neither good nor bad why Lehigh continued the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for Off where for man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other. So God is really giving us our moral agency because of opposition men and women would be placed in the way of constant choice and with each choice. They were choosing who they were in fact building who they were Moment by moment before all of the choices of life and in the face of extenuating circumstances. We choose courage or cowardice love or the bitter ashes of resentment obedience or apathy Devotion to Christ or to today's popular opinion discipline over appetite. These aren't just random choices because one accumulated on another build one's very Soul because the opposition is so real the enticements. So compelling there is a grounding power that comes from good choice. In the face of real opposition it reminds me of a sculpture. We saw once by Gary Price. It was a self-portrait of the sculptures sculpting himself choosing what he was stroke for stroke and chisel line-by-line opposition. Was there from the beginning and to bring about his eternal purposes in the Garden of Eden there was an opposition even the forbidden fruit in opposition to the Tree of Life the one being sweet and the other bidder, Preston Oaks. Said if Adam and Eve had not made the choice that introduce mortality Lehigh taught. They would have remained in a state of Innocence doing no good for they knew no sin from the beginning agency and opposition were Central to the father's plan and to Satan's Rebellion against it as the Lord revealed to Moses in the Council of Heaven Satan sought to destroy the agency of man that destruction was inherent in the terms of Satan's offer. He came before the father and said behold here. Am I send me I will be lie son and I will redeem all mankind that one Soul shall not be lost. And surely I will do it wherefore give me thine honor president has continued the Satan proposed to carry out the father's plan in a way that would prevent the accomplishment of the father's purpose and give Satan his glory Satan's proposal would have ensured perfect. Equality, it would redeem all mankind that not one Soul would be lost. There would be no agency or Choice by anyone and therefore no need for opposition. There would be no tests no failure and no success. There would be no growth to attain the purpose the father desired for his children all of us experience various kinds of opposition that tests us. Some of these tests are Temptations to sin some are mortal challenges apart from personal sins. Some are very great. Some are minor some are continuous. And those are the hardest I think and some are mere episodes. None of us is exempt opposition permits us to grow toward what our heavenly father would have us become our development Demands a tough road for the Lord isn't making party guests of us, but Sons and Daughters who have become like him through a process. He has designed think about a world without law. Law there really would be no goodness or evil there would be no standard to appeal to to interpret. What was right or wrong all would be chaos. And what happens in chaos, somebody's will finally prevails. It is often the strongest or the most ruthless or the Tyrant who has a Will To Power we can see that in our secular world that has given up any sense of Truth or Eternal law the highest standard we can come up with is Moral relativism or as so many put it you do you when there is not a sense of right or wrong any terrible thing goes though. This experience on Earth would teach us competence and character and though our choices are of Paramount importance. Ultimately. There is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God save it be through the merits and mercy and Grace of the Holy messiah. In other words. We are not earning our way to heaven art. Time on Earth is prolonged and is a probation so that we may repent and take this glorious gift Adam feel that men might be and men are that they might have joy experiencing the sweet and the bitter was necessary and the joy even through the opposition is real because we have a savior just as Jacobs blessing is particular to him. So is Joseph where Lehigh quotes at length from Joseph of Egypt's words on the plates of brass. He truly prophesied concerning all his seed and the prophecies which he wrote. There are not many greater when she loved to have access to those plates of brass that are filled with the words. We do not have the words of Xena can Cena Sani. Mm and the great words of Joseph who was sold into Egypt and then save the house of Israel. That would be so exciting. And great were the covenants of the Lord which he made unto Joseph. Joseph was told in a blessing from his father Jacob that he is a fruitful bough by a well his branches run over the wall. We also learn from the Joseph Smith translation Genesis chapter 50 25 that of his people a branch shall be broken off and shall be carried into a far country nevertheless. They shall be remembered in the covenants of the Lord. This is Old in large measure by Lehi and his family who leave the boundaries of Jerusalem and the old world. They had known to find their way to a promised land in the Americas one day pondering this. I was taught something by the spirit and you know, how you love it. When all of a sudden there's an Aha and you know, it's been a gift when Joseph had to leave the rest of the children of Israel his family behind to go to Egypt. It was for a purpose it was to feed them and save them when the world was in famine. And later, I realized that Lehi and his family had followed the same type They too had been sent away from their people. They were the branches that run over the wall for the same purpose. What they would create the Book of Mormon was also to feed the world in a time of famine it echoes what the Lord says in Amos chapter 8 verse 11 behold the days come saith the Lord God that I will send a famine in the land. And not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the lord. We also learn in this blessing that Joseph of Egypt more than 3,000 years before Joseph Smith's birth spoke of him for Joseph of Egypt truly saw our day and was told a choice Seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins? And he shall be esteemed highly among the fruit of thy loins and unto him will I give Commandment that he shall do a work? Work which shall be of great worth even to the bringing of them to the knowledge of the covenants, which I have made with thy father's there's that same teaching again that they will remember those covenants and his name shall be called after me and it shall be after the name of his father and he shall be like unto me for the thing, which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand by the power of the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation. Consider this before Moses led the children of Israel out of Egypt before the Red Sea was parted before he received Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai long before when Joseph was serving in Pharaoh's Court about 1500 BC so far back in The Mists of antiquity. We cannot see much Joseph of Egypt already knew of Joseph Smith. In fact knew of him by name this detail of God's orchestration expands our puny. Mine's I just love that I do too. It's interesting that in early America fathers often named their oldest son after themselves and Joseph Smith's father was indeed Joseph Smith, but that is not how it went in the Smith family. The oldest son did not get his father's name first Lucy and Joseph had an infant son who is not named then their family order goes like this Alvin Hiram sophronia Joseph the Joseph. Who is the prophet of the restoration was the fifth child? And why did they finally get around to naming a son Joseph? They did not know they were fulfilling a prophecy that had been in place for at least 3,000 years Joseph of Egypt also knew that his descendant named Joseph would bring forth the Lord's word that would also convince the people of the word that had already gone forth among them an important role of the Book of Mormon is to Bear testimony of the truthfulness of the Bible. So Now we get to what I know is one of your favorite parts of the Book of Mormon Marin its second Nephi chapter 4 and we call it Nephi's Psalm because of their sins Lehigh does not give blessings to Laman and Lemuel but he does give them to their children who have inherited their wicked teachings. He promises these grandchildren that they will not utterly perish and the Lord's Mercy will be upon them. Then Lehi dies and Laman and Lemuel are murderously angry at Nephi one more time. In these conditions Nephi begins to sorrow and we see a glimpse of his inner life and vulnerabilities in the last verses of chapter 4 beginning with verse 16. He writes behold my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard nevertheless notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord in showing me his great and marvelous Works my heart exclaiming with oh Wretched Man that I am yay my heart sorrow with because of My Flesh my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities. I am encompassed about because of the Temptations and the sins, which do so easily beset me. Nephi is really low here and he shares this with us freely. He has reason to struggle but look what he does with it. He says o Wretched Man that I am and my heart's so Earth because of My Flesh yet. He has learned how to move out of this place of inner heaviness and darkness. It is a lesson. We can all learn from him. He not only turns to the Lord he moves into the light by embracing true ideas. Here is the Turning Point these important words. Nephi says I know in whom I have trusted that's right. He has to acknowledge this truth and from that Central truth. Everything else can be good. What? The Lord done for him. Nephi says he hath filled me with his love. He has confounded mine enemies. He has had Visions in the nighttime in angels ministered to him. Mine eyes have beheld the great things Che even to great for man. Clearly. Nephi leaves the blindness of his wretchedness behind when he begins to focus on the truth of God's unwavering support for him. There's your pattern for your dark days. That is the time to remind yourself of the truth. If I may be having a hard time now, but I really do know that God is there I do remember times I felt his love I do know that he has been there for me before he's answered my prayers. He's come through in every circumstance and just talking about that truth begins to fill your soul with light even in the darkest time. It does that always lifts you to have that truth go through your mind and heart it's because truth is light we can say with Nephi. Oh Lord, I Have trusted in me and I will trust in thee forever. We love you listeners your dear to us. We think about you all the time. We are preparing these podcasts. Thanks for so many of you who reach out to us.

I'm your host shall in Leicester and you might know me from my YouTube channel where I analyzed celeb relationships and Scandals for the lessons. We can take into our own lives. But here in the podcast. I answer the questions you submitted over the past week. And today we're going to be talking about anxiety friends who need help friends who are making trouble flat first a conversations and why guys pay so much attention to the Skank and just a reminder that if you want to chat privately with me find me on the instant Go app by user name is shallon XO and click chat to get connected. Also. Be sure to rate and review this podcast if you like it and find me on YouTube for for new videos a week. So Brianna asked me this question. She said I'm in a really good relationship with my boyfriend except that he's diagnosed with anxiety and takes medicine for it to help and this affects his sexual life. And sometimes he has erection problems. And for me sex is really important in a relationship. But once in a while like I have to cope with this issue and like we can't have sex and I get sometimes angry or frustrated which causes us to fight. So what do you think is this a deal breaker or can this be improved and how because right now? I'm like at the end of my rope. So you guys might have seen the video I did on anxiety. I actually took it down because Zayn Malik was not happy that I called him the thing that I called him, which I won't repeat but hmm anyway, but in that video I say that anxiety is basically two things. It's self-absorption with the perceived sense of powerlessness, right because when we get anxious we go into Spirals and there's Spirals about what's going to happen to us what's going to happen when it gets going to happen to me was going to go to the world and how with what's happening to the world. How is that going to affect me me me? And then the powerlessness is the key component because it's natural to worry about ourselves and the world around us, but it's the aspect of like I can't do anything about this. I'm on a plane and I can't fix it if it crashes and I can't stop it and I'm going to die things like that. And so I have kind of a different / radical approach to anxiety which is stop fucking medicating yourself. I mean, yes, of course, there's situations where people you know, you need medication to just kind of take the hysteria off so that you can think more clearly but I think we are being way over medicated for things that are like normal life events. I hear you guys say like I've been diagnosed with anxiety because I'm going away to college like girl what you're dealing. Dealing with is life its life. Of course, you're going to be anxious making a major life shift. You're going away to college. You're leaving a marriage. You're starting a new job. You're in a new town. Someone passed away. You broke up with someone. This is life. This comes standard on human. And we need to develop coping skills. We can't just put a pill in our mouth and just because we can take a pill for something doesn't mean that we should because look we're finding out a lot about drug companies lately right these Side effects are oftentimes built-in I is I know that sounds crazy. And I know I sound like a bit of a conspiracy theorist but this is like a proven thing drug companies will make a drug with a side effect and oh wait a minute. They also just happen to make Viagra. Let's write a prescription for that. Like that's just business practices and we can bury our head in the sand or we can be like, okay, maybe Western medicine isn't good for every single problem we have don't worry. I'm not an anti-vaxxer. Anything like that, but like we owe it to ourselves and our bodies and certainly like the people around us to explore things in a more holistic way. So like I told Brianna like obviously don't tell your boyfriend like go cold turkey and like I don't know his medical history. I'm not a doctor but I just play one on TV, but like look for more holistic options and look for things that are cognitive behavioral shifts like he needs to be seeing a therapist because cognitive behavioral therapist can help. You come up with real-world coping mechanisms for anxiety, like one thing I do because I get anxious to I get really socially anxious with people kind of don't assume because I'm very socially fluid but so I like anesthetize myself with food and alcohol, like I'm always eating something or drinking something if I'm like the center of attention in a group because it's I'm anxious. So what I do is I give a name to my anxiety and I used to literally say it out loud. I would sit there be like anxious anxious anxious bored bored bored. Bored bored anxious anxious anxious and for whatever reason just naming it helped like even me just saying that now like made me feel a lot better. It's like this pause. It's a deep breath and it's a recognition of what's going on because monsters live in the dark, right and when we don't give a name to someone or it's just this free-floating thought we're like how it has all this power over us and even just naming it can kind of help demystify it and take away some of its power and then we Take a step back and be like, all right. I'm bored. I'm anxious. I need to leave this party or I need to get out of this conversation or I need to go take a walk and eat some fruit and be outside for a little while, you know, we're more easily able to evaluate things. So look at some holistic shifts meditation probiotics, which is incredibly crucial to your body and because probiotics they mimic and they help create serotonin. They regulate serotonin levels. They regulate your immune system, you know, it's You got to be taking some goddamn probiotics. I really liked by. Okay, I'm not this is not like a paid endorsement. I just really like them. It's bi o - Kay and you can get them at Whole Foods or health food stores or whatever just make sure the refrigerated like any sort of probiotics that you take have to be cold. If they're not they're dead. So don't believe these like, you know, unless they're super fermented but like the ones you get on the Shelf at Target. They're not going to do anything for you. So invest in some good ones take them every single day and like they Early have changed my life. Like I used to have debilitating asthma and allergies and I don't anymore. I used to be on antidepressants and I'm not because I was able to regulate my serotonin levels, you know, so let's say though that this this like sexual dysfunction kinda is what it is with him. I mean, he's going to have to make the decision about whether or not he wants to look for remedies that don't have these side effects or not and like that's his life and that's his deal and Sex really is the glue that holds people together. And if you've ever been in a relationship where you don't have that sexual chemistry, you know how true that is. It sucks. And especially when you're young like who wants to be in a sexless relationship when you're young like come on and I also think it's like this is my little feminist tangent. You know Lube is like the worst thing to happen to feminism because oh she's not wet. Oh, I didn't warm her up. No big deal. Let me just squirt some lube on there and keep going. But if a man doesn't get an erection the world comes to a grinding halt, you know, like you don't just tape it to a popsicle. Sip stick and keep on going right you stop the whole thing stops. There's no more sex life. He's not just going to go down on you for two hours and not have sex like it's a whole shift and so I don't really Advocate that. You know, it makes me mad. I don't even know if I have a point for this it just it just makes me mad but there are some things you can do to boost the sexy kind of mode. One thing I like to do is have like Sexy book club with my boyfriend were we each like read like the same like erotic novel and if you're new to the whole erotic novel thing because it is like silly and cringy but that's also part of the fun, you know, but if you're new to it start with 50 Shades of Grey, you know, it's easy, it's Dom you can laugh at it together, but you could also act out some of the scenes together. You can roll Swap and it'll just get you in a sexier frame of mind where you're talking about it and you're thinking about it and like that could help a lot. Not because right now what has medication is doing is just dialing everything down right? Because it's it's kind of like how chemotherapy is just kind of like a bomb that goes off in your system and it wipes out everything good and bad to try to kill the bad the same with anti-anxiety meds. Like it's not so specialized that it only dials down the main it dials down every single aspect of your personality your creativity your sex drive but like also, yeah your temper and your Mania I like my sex drive and Like my grid tivity and I even kind of like my temper. So that's why I look for Holistic Solutions to stuff like this. So if you're in this situation either with yourself or with a partner really really explore your options acupuncture Eastern Arts and Sciences herbs and spices like Kentucky Fried Chicken, like there are answers out there because everything that we're experiencing now is humans ain't nothing new Under the Sun baby people in the Middle Ages. They had anxiety to people in the time of Confucius they had issues as well. And they came up with Solutions. So look around the answers are out there and it might have like such a benefit for your mind and your body and your relationship. This next question comes from a Nicole and builds kind of on our last question about anxiety, which is how to help someone who's in trouble. So she says I have a situation with my best friend Jen from high school that I need help with she and I have been friends since eighth grade and we're juniors in college now and our Dynamic has really changed as most people do when they grow up. However her family moved from California to Georgia. So we can't see each other during school breaks and she had a really hard time last year which resulted in her losing like literally all of her friends at school. She's struggling with an eating. Sorter, which honestly I have as well when I'm still working through it, and this whole summer. I felt like a crutch for her. I visited her last month for a 21st birthday in Georgia, and honestly, it was terrible. She was throwing up her food after meals and lying about it. She was comparing herself to me, and honestly, it just wasn't the same with us. Nothing terrible happened on the trip, but I left just feeling gross. I live in LA and I live a very fast and exciting life like you do. Thank you, and honestly, I don't have Like I have my own problems that I have worked on this summer and I feel like this is setting me back and honestly, I just don't have time to be her only virtual friend. It's like I'm only friends with her out of pity and guilt at this point because I don't know what I'm getting out of this relationship and I feel like a bitch because I don't want to abandon her but I have literally been the best friend to her and she hasn't always been for me. I've done everything in my power to help her and I just resent her to the point where a even tried to pick a fight with her so I could have Time to not speak with her and that's just not who I am at all and I want to do the right thing help also. Love you. So yeah, I get this and I'm so sorry that you have to deal with this kind of dynamic especially since like you're tackling this issue on your own you're dealing with these own things and I understand the feeling and I think the reason Jen keeps leaning on you so much is because you're dealing with this too. You're an easy target. You have a huge amount of empathy for her and honestly, probably not a lot of people Do at least not in the long run, you know at your age everyone is dealing with something and nobody really wants to play therapist. Nobody really has that kind of elasticity and honestly like at no point in our lives we want to play therapist for other people. I mean, I guess I do it for a living like in my own life, like nobody likes that kind of one-sided friendship. So sometimes I think it's helpful to pull back and and to get some objectivity to reframe circumstances in a different light like if she were a drug You would not feel guilty about giving her a little bit of tough. Love you would absolutely not tolerate her shooting up at the table dragging you along to see a drug dealer mocking your sobriety, right you would sit her down and say this. So here's your script. Look. I understand that you're suffering believe me, but I can't be the one to fix you. You have to be the one who wants to fix themselves and I understand that this is not an overnight thing. It's a journey, but I don't see You taking the steps on that journey and until I do this situation. I need to step back from because my involvement at this point feels like enabling you and since I'm going through a lot of these things on my own. I can't sacrifice my progress for yours and she will probably rage and she will get mad and call you a bad friend. You're abandoning me. But remember the people who don't want you to have boundaries are the people who benefited from you having none at all. She's pulling on your heartstrings because she She'll respond and there's a reason she doesn't have any other friends people actually don't like to be manipulated. They don't need it. They're going to look at her and be like the fuck am I sticking around for what? Why do I need this dynamic in my life, right? It's exhausting and it's fruitless and tell her that you will be by her side if she wants to get help in a healthy and constructive way. But if she's not going to do that, you are not going to sit here and watch the car crash. Any submitted this next question and she's going through something that I know a lot of you guys have experienced. So she said I've been with my first boyfriend for a month now and I've noticed that my best friend has acted super weird ever since we became official. She's been really distant and ignores my texts that have anything to do with him. I get the feeling that there's some jealousy there since she's single and she's the type of person who is always talking about wanting a relationship and constantly needs attention from guys. I'm just frustrated because I wish he could just be Happy for me, but she has just been really judgmental. Honestly, do you have any idea what's going on or how I could address this with her? So yeah, basically you're exactly right. She can't be happy for you because she feels like she either deserves this kind of happiness more or she just plain wants it for herself. So I would sit her down and be really real with her. Tell her basically exactly what you told me. I really would love it if I could talk to you about my relationship, but you seem to be really bitter and honestly, it's putting a huge divide in our friendship and I don't know how to fix it apart from breaking up with the guy. I like which I'm not going to do because this friendship shouldn't cost me other relationships. I wouldn't ask that of you and I don't think it's fair that you potentially tacitly or overtly ask that of me. She's probably not even aware of what she's doing or certainly not to the degree. So give her a little bit of reality because yo, this is life. People are going to have boyfriends. They're even going to marry. They're gonna have a husband's one day. They're gonna have children grandchildren. She needs to learn how to deal with it and reconcile that other people having something that she wants doesn't mean she doesn't get to have it. She has that potential there's enough seats at the table for everyone. You having a boyfriend doesn't mean she's doomed to walk the earth alone forever. You know, if anything she should be learning by example on how you manage to find a healthy relationship, but this could just be another example of someone who prefers to be a victim they like their victim narrative and if that's the case, she's not your problem to solve you might just have to kind of put her on the back burner as someone who is now just a tangential friend versus a main priority, but talk to her and see what she says and most importantly see what she does from there on out. And it also might be helpful to like because maybe she's feeling like logistically slighted like maybe you guys would get mani-pedis every Friday and now you're with the boyfriend so set up intentional time for just you girls, you know, whether it's a sleepover or a dinner or a binge watch or whatever let her know that she's a priority in that way. But like I said, this could just be some weird pathology she has and she just might straight up not be happy for you. And if that's the case, you don't need someone in your life who wishes you ill. Even if they're not connected to that feeling if anything then like not connecting to it is more dangerous because then they're going to do things and like with this plausible deniability of like well, I didn't mean to I didn't mean to DM your boyfriend. It's not it's no big deal. Like I want an enemy with an agenda. You know what I mean? I don't want a snake in sheep's clothing. I want to know who I'm dealing with because like intentionality doesn't really do much like so Why didn't mean to hurt you? I didn't mean to be mean. All right, well drunk drivers probably don't mean to kill anyone. It doesn't mean it's not possible. So sit her down talk to her about it. She might have a Moment of clarity and Awakening be like, oh my God, you're right. I've been such a jerk or she just might keep entrenching herself into this victim narrative, and it's only going to get worse. This next question comes from Annie. She said I'm 20 and the guy I like is 25 we met through a friend at a party. He got my number from that friend and a few days later. He texted me. He's been texting me regularly for two weeks and this week. He started calling me every night. He always is the one to initiate contact and we have plans to hang out in a group next week. How do I know if he's just being socially friendly or if he's interested in dating me Ciro. Well guys, don't do things just to be nice like That's not what they do. They it's not in their nature. It's not in their inclination and part of the reason they don't do that is because Society doesn't expect that of them Society does expect women to be nice be polite all there's this weird girl. You should take her out for lunch. It's like no no one asks that of men so they don't do it and that just goes to show that that's Baseline human behavior, you know, and that we act like that because we're conditioned to so no, he's not doing that if a guy is talking to a girl it's because he's interested in her. But what kind of interest is a whole other story? I think it's a really big red flag that he's five years older and I know that five years on paper doesn't look like much and it isn't if you were 30 and he was 35 or you were 27 and he was 32 but 20 and 25 years old. It is a really big difference in terms of what I call Life Arenas like when I was 20, I was a virgin in a small college town when I was 25. I was an editor of a magazine in New York. That's a huge difference in my life Arenas a huge difference in my sexual experience Arenas. I mean just a difference in like living on my own and how I dressed completely changed and 25 a guy should not feel like he emotionally has a lot in common with the 20 year old girl and it has nothing to do with how mature she is because like obviously and is a very mature person, you know, I mean, we all are women mature so much faster. So maturity-wise. Yes. She's maybe more on his level. It's the issue of him not being on hers because it's about those Arenas if he's going for girls in a different Arena than his that means he can't keep up with girls in his own sphere. He's doing things that they would maybe call bullshit on or not actually be impressed by it all or the tactics he's using, you know would be a red flag to them guys who chronically go for way younger girls do it because they like the control. They don't want someone who's going to call them out. They want someone who's going to be easily Bamboozled and easier to manipulate and you being less Actually experience is also a huge plus he might not be able to compete with people his own age in that category either, you know, so that's why I see some red flags in terms of his intentions if you guys met two weeks ago, he should have seen you by now. If you're in the same town or reasonably close and I think that's why he's keeping so much communication and escalating this because he knows he's going to see you in a group setting and he's going to try to have sex with you. Basically if he wanted to pursue you in a legitimate way, he would be setting legitimate dates. He wouldn't wait for a group hang out because His men are hunters and a hunter doesn't want to get the girl. He likes around other Hunters who might catch her eye. I mean we get so confused about a guy's Behavior. But sometimes we just need to put it flip it and reverse. It's like if I had a guy who I liked who was talking to me and seemed in to me. Would I wait two weeks to see him in a group setting with other chicks fucked? No, I'd be like, let's go. Let's hang out tomorrow. I want to see you ASAP, right? You don't bide your time that goes for men and for women. So I would be really really cautious. So he wants you to know that you're interested in him and only him and he would do that by asking you on the solo date so he can have all your attention, you know, if he's a quality dude. So yeah be cautious. He's probably going to pay a lot of attention to you at this party and it's probably going to give you a few drinks and then maybe you know what I'm just not feeling this. Let's get out of here. Let's get away from this crowd. Let's go back to my place girl and if that's all you're after okay fine, but I bet it isn't because cause who wants to just get humped and dumped, you know, who wants someone that's paying all this attention and leading them down this road of like meaningful connection just like oh actually I just want to stick it in by because texting isn't hard if you can do something on the toilet. It doesn't count as courtship bold statement hot take if you can do that while pooping hate using that word. It's not a grand gesture whether it's texting whether it's liking your photos on Instagram or dming you or even posting a pic. It doesn't count. I want to see IRL things if his internet without if Wi-Fi went out across the world. Would you still have evidence that he liked you right? I have to ask myself that. What's he doing IRL? Because yeah who wants to be the Goodtime girl who wants to just have a guy pay all this tension and then dropped them once I've hooked up no one and you're better than that. Okay, this question is a wild ride so buckle up. Okay. So Kim is like I've been dating this guy for like the better part of a year. We've been a little bit long distance, but like, you know reasonably close and recently we broke up because I found out surprised he has a whole other girlfriend in a whole other city like a years long relationship and basically she's also like kind of famous I'm like dying to know she has but she won't tell me it doesn't matter and I don't know if I should tell this woman that like yo your boyfriend had a whole other girlfriend like part of me knows that she's going to freak out and like lash out at me, but I don't know like I just feel like it's my duty and I also just really want to like fuck him over. So I mean, I think all of us have been in a relationship or a situation ship where we realize that the person we've been devoting time to surprise actually has either a whole of the girlfriend sometimes a wife sometimes a wife and children sometimes a wife and a different girlfriend and children like men's capacity for duplicity knows no bounds no bounds whatsoever. And you know, it's I was actually kind of in the situation recently like my high school boyfriend is getting married and he's a monster like he beat me up when I was like when we got back together at like 25 and I went through this same kind of debate. Like should I tell his fiancee What kind of person he is? I reached the conclusion that like no fuck her like they're getting married at the Trump Golf course. I'm like, you know what? No. No, but like either she knows and she's like fine with it and it just also not a situation I need to wade back into I have moved on. I don't need to dip my toe in that kind of toxicity and like I said, you know after they've been together for a few years ostensibly like she I guarantee she knows what kind of person she is and she's either Thinking she can change him or just doesn't care or maybe she's just as crazy. I have no idea and I don't care but in this situation, I actually think Kim should confront the check because look I would want to know right all of us would want to know because the thing with cheating the thing that's so difficult about it is because that means you've been making decisions based on a reality that doesn't actually exist. You know what I mean? You're making plans you're prioritizing someone. This reality. This world simply isn't there. So I you know, I believe in Walking in the light of the truth. And sometimes we have to kind of shine a light on something. Somebody else's truth and look, of course. She's going to hate you. She's probably going to blame you but you're not responsible for someone else's reactions. I think he deserves a little bit of what's coming to him. I am big on Revenge because in the end of the day, he's just a liar and an asshole and he's absolutely not about to dump her. Oh, yeah. That's what she said. Like. Oh, he said that he's about to dump it. Horseshit horse shit horseshit. No chance never believe a guy when he says that never never never never. It's just a lie, and when you walk out of his life, he's just gonna look around for a replacement and he's going to keep doing this and having multiple girlfriends for as long as anybody lets him because he's an asshole. So yeah, I would tell her if I had a boyfriend who had a hold of the girlfriend. I would want to know and of course maybe going to hate you. She's maybe going to blame you but like again that's not your problem. So I would get in touch with her and tell her in the most neutral way possible. This is the script. Hey, Woman to woman I would want to know this if I was in your situation, but your boyfriend has been dating me for the past several months and not telling me he was in a relationship with you when I called him out. He said you were crazy and he was about to dump you. I know that I deserve better than this guy and I guarantee that you do too. So I wanted you to walk in the light of the truth about who this person is and she freaks out and call you crazy. Fuck it. That's her funeral. You did all that you can do and all you can do is all you can do just block her and keep moving on with your life. Don't try to get Further involved but if you don't think that like confronting her will be like a one and done situation if deep down be honest with yourself. If you're kind of doing this to keep the dynamic going because you want to provoke a confrontation where they break up and you get him don't do that. He is never going to stop cheating on people never you're just going to move up into her slot and then he's going to go out and find another you. This question comes from Kelly and she's dealing with something that I know a lot of us have stressed about before going on a date. She's like shallon. I have a date coming up with this guy and we've been texting for a few weeks but like his texts are really dry. Like I get flat answers one word. I feel like I'm the one moving the conversation along and so I'm worried about the date and like I'm literally thinking like do I have to have like conversational topics ready? I don't know and we've hung out before and had really good chemistry. So Maybe he's just a bad texter. I'm honestly not sure and I'm kind of freaking out so I used to stress about this too. And sometimes yes, I would literally go into dates with like prepared conversational notes and topics basically like on my phone and now I realize that that was really working against me long-term relationships and stable situations. They got a lot of downtime a lot and I need to know that someone I'm with can carry a conversation because Let It Be the the guys job to keep the chitchat flowing. I mean, I don't sit there and like silent is a hostage. Obviously. I'm pretty chatting myself. But I also don't put the burden on myself anymore to jibber-jabber the entire time so that there's no awkward silences for one. Like I said, I need to be dating someone who can carry their share of the conversational load because if you can't that is a crucial data point also I tend to get panicky and anxious and just mama no, I'm like a turkey. I just talked and talked and talked which means I'm not effectively Evaluating who this guy really is. I'm missing signals and I'm missing red flags because I'm just tap dancing as fast as I can from across the table, you know, and like most importantly guys don't want a girl who can't handle a little bit of Silence because like I said relationships have a lot of downtime and if a girl was on a date talking talking talking nonstop, he's going to assume that she needs constant entertainment which translates to high-maintenance dramatic and always, Looking like I mean for a fight, you know, so let the conversation unfold how it unfolds and remember if he can't think of anything to ask you a virtual stranger. Then why do you want to be with this person? I want my boyfriend to really be curious about my life. I want him to Delight in my stories and finding out more about me. I want him to genuinely. I don't know give a shit. Are we really asking too much for a guy to want to speak to their girlfriend? Wow Pie in the Sky crazy crazy goals. So if it's awkward, That's not something you need to fix but rather observe and Note and maybe he's only good over text. Anyway, you know, maybe his texting is as good as it gets a lot of guys are like that because we can curate like our texts and we like this is how online dating gets us into trouble because we have this amazing banter and Rapport on the text in the message Bubba and then we meet up and it's like who the fuck are you? It's like either the chemistry doesn't align the attraction isn't there or like? Oh did you? Have a co-author for those texts because you were boring AF in real life, like maybe you're nervous or whatever but this just like isn't working. So don't stress. You always got to go into a date with one attitude. What is he bringing to me? I don't care if he likes me. I mean, of course I do. Yes, but I lived so many years of my dating life just like I always say like a dog chasing a car. What would I do if I caught it? I was obsessed with them liking me it literally didn't occur to me to Stop and be like do I like him? I evaluated that in terms of like sexual tracks doing a fucking movie hot. Is he cute would he make like a great guy to flex on Instagram, you know, but in terms of like interpersonal connection, I mean, I look back on the people. I got super Twisted on I'm like, I can't tell you one thing about their personality. They certainly weren't funny. I don't remember them being smart or just, you know, interesting diverse quirky. Even even weird is better than flat but I was like they have to like me why girl why it comes back to that core of self-esteem that I always talk about and being okay being single because if we're going to let someone in our life and waste our precious energy and time and are good boob years and are full face of college in years. They got to be bringing something to the table. So go into it with that attitude. You're here to impress me. This next question comes from Olivia and she's dealing with something that you guys ask me about all the time. But she's seeing it from a different angle, which is really interesting. So she's like, okay, so I hooked up with this guy Fernando back in 2017, and I'm like, you know, we were dating for a little while and then when we were on a break he hooked up with this chick she was like 18 and just trash like she post all these slutty pictures and about Raves and like she's wearing nothing and like she's just she's got a ho Evite. But online right see what I'm talking about with what you post on Instagram and like I see the he still keeps in touch with her and then in 2018, we were like kind of back together but basically on and off and he's a douche and he's out of my life, but he's still lurking her Pages. He's typical common is like goddess like emoji with the heart eyes emoji with the heart eyes, and he's a douche like I know I know but it just always made me feel so insecure that he was giving this girl who was like trashy. She and trampy all of this attention that he never gave to me and like I have a good head on my shoulders. I'm smart. I have a good job. Like I'm an adult and I just I'm so irritated and I hate myself for being irritated that I care that he's giving attention to someone who just seems so lame. All right, so don't envy this girl for one her social media is a goddamn mess. I looked but the larger issue is that yeah, I hear from girls in this position all day all day every day. I got hooked up with like I hooked up with this guy. He creep my Instagram. He leaves flirty comments, but he doesn't actually pursue me or have feelings for me. That's because he views this girl as a possession a fuck toy a means to an end when he's horny or board and him leaving his little Hence, that's bread crumbing classic bread crumbing these tiny sporadic trickle of attention to Keep Her On the Hook to reminder that he's there. So when he's bored and wants to bang she's an easy layup, you know because it's not like, oh I haven't talked to you in two years. It's like no you have I've been leaving emojis. Remember what I said about if you can do it on the toilet, it's not a gesture. Yeah, and he doesn't do that with you simply because he knows it won't work fuck boys can sense a quality girl. They have a radar for weaknesses and low self-esteem which he has and they know that that kind of girl is going to be easy to manipulate and hook up with with the absolute bare minimum of effort toilet effort, but for someone like her that's kind of all she requires. She has set up that persona for herself. She has made the bar that low. So that's who she's going to attract low bar. Men you require more and for that reason he doesn't even want to get involved because he doesn't have the capability. T to be the kind of person that you would allow in his in your life take it as a compliment. That's all for this week Challengers. Thanks for tuning in.

Thank you so much for listening. Happy Gemini season now onto your horoscope. Hello, Jim, and I thank you so much for listening. You are listening to the audio horoscope for the month ahead of Gemini season. This is your season. Happy birthday Gemini. I'm wishing you all the best in your season. The sun is in your sign. It is radiating your kind of light. The light of Gemini season is a really interesting and magical light in the northern hemisphere. This is the season when We have the culmination of daylight. So the very last day of Gemini season is the eve of The Longest Day in the year and in the southern hemisphere. It's the opposite the longest night in the year. Gemini is a sign that is known for Duality and for holding the complexity of multiple points of view. It is a shape shifter. It is a Wanderer. It's a translator and it is a jokester and for are you Gemini rules your solar first house? And that means that this is part of your identity as a person with Gemini in the first house or sun in Gemini. You are a person who is here to teach us all about what it means to have a sense of humor to see multiplicities and plurality xand many different sides of stories to hold complexities with ease and curiosity. You're also a person who needs to learn to live from your heart. Your mind is very active and Way that Gemini needs to grow and itself is through understanding that true connection comes from love. You have a very sharp mind and this month as the sun moves into Gemini and your ruling planet Mercury also moves into Gemini. They form a conjunction on the very first day of Gemini season. This marks a time when mental activity is high and you may have a lot going on. There might be feelings of trying to understand yourself or having a lot of focus on yourself a lot of internal energy or self reflecting energy this conjunction between the Sun and Mercury is also an important part of the Mercury retrograde cycle and if you think back to March or so, it may be that in these last couple of months. You've been preparing yourself in some ways to be a little bit different in the world how you present yourself. How you communicate how you connect with? Is is changing and as we get into your season it's a time to start to experiment with these changes. They'll happen. Naturally. You don't have to intend to them at all, but just notice how your communication is Shifting how your mind is Shifting and the way that you make associations is Shifting again the message for you is always to deepen in your heart to connect with your heart when you get caught up in your mind. It is not good news for you. You are very intelligent. Agent your mind is sharp, but when the mind takes leadership or is dominant not good news. If you can connect your heart with your mind good news, and the good news for this month is that you'll have a lot of opportunity to do that. So the first week of Gemini season is a week when there are several powerful aspects that for you are coming into again your personality and your identity, especially as you relate with Ideas of yourself in a larger social context. So for some of you this might mean work that you're doing in the world and how you're seeking to affect a larger whole how you're engaging with social or humanitarian causes for others. This may mean friends networks how you feel yourself as a part of a group for others of you this may mean the idea or worry or hope of future outcome and how you are being received or of doubt in the world and for some of you it could be all three of these things. So as I said several powerful aspects this week, and there is a lot of energy for you to notice any habits of insecurity or holding back really bring your attention to the ways that you might get bound up with insecurities or that you might feel somehow inhibited or limited by kind of deeper belief patterns that you might hold below the surface. Or any kind of trauma that you may be carrying that affects you socially as we move through the week and get into the fourth quarter Square, which is exact on May 26th. You may have several important realizations about how your energy is Rippling out and affecting the world around you and therefore affecting you as a person in the world. This is a really good time just to practice awareness. There's nothing that you need. To do during this time except for notice. How are you in your social life? How do you respond to the world around you? What do you feel like you need to give how do you feel like you need to be and then really seek again to come into your heart as we get into the next week May 30th through June 2nd Mercury makes excuse me, Venus makes a number of aspects and this is I think really going to help you live in that heart space, so these couple of days Could bring quite a bit of emotional intensity. There may be a lot of openings. You might be feeling some pretty profound or deep feelings. And there may be releasing a feelings that you haven't felt it yet or that have been kind of brewing for some time. If this is true for you ultimately it's positive its allowing energy to move its clearing some space the the main key here in these couple of days in general, but definitely these couple of days Again, feel your heart try and really ground in your own truth really pay attention to what is true for you if you get caught up in trying to figure out what's going on for other people or if you get confused about how you should be presenting yourself in the world or if it feels like there are demands on you from your social connections your partners or the folks around you to be something that you're not take a deep breath in tape a deep exhale. And let all of that go you're fully allowed right now to have your own process and it's really important that you give yourself space and time to do that. There's a new moon in your sign on Monday June 3rd. And this new moon comes in at 12 degrees of Gemini. The new moon is always a great time to set intentions for a new beginning. And for those of you who are Gemini son. This is your birthday month and it's really natural to set intentions for the next year if your Gemini rising In great. Think ahead for your next year. This is a big part of your identity. How do you want to grow? What is it that you are calling in for your own identity. How do you want to see yourself evolving from May of 2019 into May of 2020 around the new moon on the day of June 3rd or a day or two after June 4th or 5th great times to set these intentions and to carve some space and time out for yourself for a little bit of a ritual. New Beginning on June 4th Mercury enters the sign of Cancer and it will Transit cancer through June 28th as mercury enters cancer. It meets up with Mars that is there currently and the two of them will move into a conjunction that is exact on the 18th Mars and Mercury will also both be forming aspects to the North Node and they'll be forming several important aspects to other places in the chart for you cancer is the part of the chart that has to do with your value and your value systems self esteem self worth feelings of worthiness or enoughness are really big themes as well as your actual value values your valuables your money your assets your relationship to finances and resources Etc. So as mercury and Mars move through this part of your chart, it's a really wonderful time to make some Headway. As part of your life to gain confidence to articulate and speak out loud. What it is that you would like to call in or what kinds of affirmations you want to put forward for your own self worth and self development with the North Node here and several Clips is coming later in the year. It's a really good time to call in some new energy. This is a great time to ask for what you want and need again. The exact conjunction of mercury with Mars is anju. June 18th and leading up to that point there may be quite a lot of activity if there's anxiety throughout this month. Please do practice with the meditation that I offer for Gemini season, as I mentioned before your sign is one that really tends to overthink and get caught in the mental space and this meditation is for working with the element of mind and the way that our minds compare and separate and in general get pretty turned in and Around on themselves. So especially at this time but throughout the entire month. If you just need some support calming yourself on a mental level check that out on June 8 Venus will enter your sign it will Transit there through July 4th Venus is a benefic and a beautiful energy. This is a really good time for you for your self-esteem for your appearance to pay attention to your body to pay attention to your appearance to your identity. T and to really kind of commit to self love practices self love is not easy. It's not a Hallmark card and it's certainly not only about yourself as you work to really love yourself you unpack a lot of internalized stories from your family from your culture ancestry Etc to really love yourself. You have to confront a whole lot of bullshit in the world and that's a great time to do it. June through July with Venus's support so kind of getting into any kinds of self-limiting beliefs and just seeking to shine the light of awareness on them when you try and eradicate something or separate or dismiss it. It tends to come back stronger. So if you find self-limiting beliefs turn towards them with compassion open your heart invite them in and just notice as they change which they probably will as soon as they're given some loving attention. On June 9th. The second quarter square is aspecting your first house of identity and your 10th House of career. There seems to be something going on right now in your future goals and the idea of how you want to be in the world right now. This is a really good day to check in with your spiritual self and kind of let go of any more mental or conceptual goals that you have for your life. Like you're a Title or you know the concepts of what you want to be your live-in to put that aside and see if you can connect just to the essence what quality do you want to be an exude and your life and what kind of quality do you want to be an exude in your future? That's something to Anchor in there may be a lot of confusion or opportunity that Isn't quite like you might not understand what it is right now in terms of your path and moving forwards. If you're moving forward into your path from a place of ambition and more of a concrete mind and especially if you're moving with a self-serving Focus, you're not so supported. If you move on to your path from a place of sacredness and integrity with your spiritual alignment you are supported in whatever your goal is. Be finally on June 17th. There's a full moon in your opposite sign of Sagittarius Sagittarius in your chart is the sign that describes your relationships with other people. This is in general the ways that you relate socially the ways that you put yourself out and kind of how you feel yourself externally in the world. But this place in your chart also has to do with important relationships and committed Partnerships the Full moon is often a time of heightened feelings and Revelation. This is a good time for you to just check in with your social self and with any contracts or commitments that you have with important people in your life. The full moon is coming very close to Jupiter and will be amplifying Jupiter's effect and Jupiter has been transiting Sagittarius since last November Jupiter is a planet of learning and growth and there's a lot of opportunity for you to expand and to Learn about yourself through your relationships this year the full moon might bring you some kind of expansive opportunity. It may also bring you a lesson that feels challenging trust that whatever is coming up is coming up because you're ready to deal with it and again continue to soften feel into your heart move kind of under and around the mental layers and do what you can to be as present as possible.

Berg healthy Ketone intermittent fasting podcast. Now your host the man taking your health to a whole new level. Dr. Eric Berg. So today, we're going to talk about how to lose more weight having a type of thyroid condition. Okay. So if you have a slow thyroid this video is for you. Here's the big problem when you do research on a hypothyroid, it's a bit complex because you have Hashimoto's hypothyroid condition you have non Hashimoto's hypothyroid condition. You're given so much advice. It's almost impossible to know. What is the absolute important things to know and what is the trivial in this video? We're going to talk about the absolute most important thing you need to focus on to get results with weight loss. If you have Hashimoto's type thyroid case or just regular hypothyroidism a few Basics. You got the thyroid right here. It's located right in the Part of the neck two and a half inches wide. It produces a hormone T4. Okay, the four represents the number of Iodine molecules, so you got four and then you got this T3 over here, right? So T 4 T 4 is an inactive thyroid hormone. It's not active. It doesn't really do much. It's a pre hormone your body strips off this one of the iodine molecules and it converts to T3 T3 is the active form of thyroid hormone. Okay, it's the thing that It goes into all the cell's and speeds up your metabolism as well as weight loss and here is the most important thing to get from this tea for two this T 3. It has to be converted. Okay, 80% of the conversion happens through your liver and 20% happens through the kidneys and this is really important information because so many people that have a hypothyroid condition have a fatty liver. I mean, it's almost one for one. If you have belly fat chances, are you have a fatty liver you can get an ultrasound to find that out but a fatty liver decreases the capacity for that conversion. So this will be your focus to get the fat off the liver and improve the function of the liver. Now, it could also be a problem with your gallbladder. It could be a problem with not having a gallbladder. It could be cirrhosis. It could be inflammation or some damage in the liver. But usually it is a fatty liver now you would think that All I need to do is cut the fat out of my diet and the fat will go away. That's not how it works in this not which one to do. You do want to cut the carbs out. Okay, that's why I'm going to recommend keto and imminent fasting but you don't want to start cutting down the fat in your diet. Okay, here are a few things to speed up. The process choline is one of the most powerful nutrients to strip fat off your liver very, Actually, you can get it in a powder. You can get in the supplement. I recommend you get a high quality choline and start taking that on a regular basis that's going to assist this nutrient is lip atrophic. It's basically dissolves fat and guess what food has the highest amount of choline eggs egg yolks interesting, right? So you don't want to start giving up those foods that are high in kolding. In fact, if you have a coaling deficiency you could Ali get a fatty liver next thing is selenium. Okay, why selenium selenium is also involved in the conversion from T4 to T3 people that have a fatty liver are nearly always deficient of selenium as well as think we'll get to this in a minute but selenium is an antioxidant so it actually gets rid of the excess hydrogen peroxide in your body that's generated, especially if you have She Moto's hypothyroidism. So selenium is essential if you have Hashimoto's this is really important because it's it's going to help your immune system. Okay, so if you have Hashimoto's you want to take some of this as a supplement and you also want to do more strict intermittent fasting that's going to drop the inflammation because Hashimoto's is more of an immune issue. Okay, but it's also involved in the conversion of T4 to T3. Yes, there's Foods high in selenium like Brazil nuts and seafood but I don't recommend trying to get all of your selenium from Foods. If you're deficient you want to take it as a supplement now, I don't want to get into the brands or dosages. I would just look online for something that looks like it has a lot of good feedback on other people that are getting good results with it. Okay, and then follow the directions on the back of the bottle. Alright, next one is iodine. Iodine is part of the raw material to build a thyroid hormone and a lot of people are deficient in Iodine so I would get this from seek help next one is zinc. Zinc is really really important taking zinc will help you in almost every single side effect that hypothyroid produces, like for example loss of hair thinning hair fatigue constipation. Zinc is good for that. Zinc is very very very very good for the thyroid. It's also good for the liver and if you have a fatty liver, You are going to be deficient in zinc. Okay think it's an oysters meet pumpkin seeds. I recommend getting it as a supplement. So these are the key things in addition to Quito and iif as your primary focus the target inductance Patty liver to improve the thyroid function. Thanks for watching.

       " \"How can you completely change your interaction with men? I talk about this today...  ---   Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/matthew-coast/messageWelcome to the forever woman podcast. I'm Matthew Coast something that I call Force Framing and this is kind of a sneaky technique. But what it does is it kind of frames conversations. I have a whole program about framing it's called The Love Fringe toolkit. And this is it's about like setting up or setting a precedent for a relationship. So setting the underlying meaning for some kind of interaction or something that's going on. Between you and another person is called Framing. And so the idea of forced framing is setting it up so that you kind of like throw this meaning onto something that he's doing and it's it's like you misinterpret it, right you you kind of take something and you interpret it in the way that you want it to be interpreted and it's kind of like a flirty fun kind of exciting thing to do and so I'm just going to give you some ideas on how to do this with him because It's a lot of fun and when you start doing it, it can completely change the interaction that you have going on with a man. Right? So it's like, you know, think about it one kind of thing that happens a lot with men and women in terms of framing is like sometimes a guy will like check out a girl right and you'll be like looking at her and she'll like catch him checking her out and she'll be like, hey were you checking me out, you know, and he's Like hot red handed and kind of like embarrassed and he's like, oh God, you know, I don't know but it but it's setting up this precedent that he likes her and he's you know looking at her and hitting on her and so that's one of the ways that you can do that and you don't even have to catch him checking you out. You can just have him you know, he's looking at you and you're like are you checking me out right now or like if you're like hanging out together and you like walk in front of and you like turn around and look at them. You might be like, well were you just checking me out right now, right? And if he's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no. No, I wasn't you can say something like it's okay. I like it. Right and so what you're doing here is you're basically setting this Frame where you're saying you like me. I just caught you liking me right looking at me in a way. That's more than friendship and it's okay, right you're giving him permission. You're like, hey, no, it's cool. I like it, which is basically saying I'm interested you're interested in me. Me and I'm interested in you and it's kind of like this fun little flirty way of having a conversation right or another one might be like stop checking me out. Right like you just made it doesn't matter if he's actually checking you out or not. Right? Because a lot of times what we do as human beings is where life walking through the world completely in our subconscious mind. We don't know what's going on. We're driving. We don't even remember getting to where we got to or walking and you know sudden we're suddenly were Where we get on the Subway or something. We aren't paying any attention. We're listening to music. And so we're most people are just walking through their lives totally unaware of anything. And so if you tell somebody that you're you caught them checking you out right? It's it's almost like they're not even aware. Maybe they were you know, they're like wait was I checking you out wasn't, you know, did that just happen? I'm not even sure right and so you can kind. And of do that and kind of have this flirty conversation going on between the two of you by just being like God. Hey, stop checking me out checking it, you know just doing it in a fun kind of flirty kind of way. Like, oh my are you checking me out again? Like no. No, it's okay. It's okay. I think it's cute. Now, I think it's cute. You know, I like it. I like it. Right and you're doing it and you're just making it fun. You're making it flirty. You're making it playful you're framing the interaction so that it's moving out of this. Hey, we're just We're just friends and we're having friendship conversations to this sexual realm this romantic realm of like we're actually interested in each other.

       " \"A note from Arlan. Hey, it's Arlen. This is a different kind of episode. You might have noticed if you've ever listened before that there was no intro music. There was no intro. It's everything's cool. This is not a sad episode at all. I just had this idea. I'm sitting at my podcast room and in Los Angeles and it's is inside my home office and I was in my apartment a few minutes ago with my wife Anna. and just as looking out the window at our view and looking around and sort of it's sort of hit me that wow. I said out loud. How did I get here? How did I get here? And she said hard work and talent and patience a little that was the kind of paraphrasing her and You know the year has been pretty tough for the most part but there have been some really beautiful moments. And and today is one of those really great moments. And so I thought let me record an episode that is just me talking. I used to do these for another podcast that I hosted called the bootstrapped VC which all of the episodes are still available if you're interested and I used to just every once in a while. Just hit record on my iPhone and talk to the to the phone as I felt we're talking to you in a room. And those were like really the most popular episodes even though we produce the rest of them. So I thought I would do that for this because I haven't really done that. Usually I record an episode even if it's a bonus episode. It goes through a great deal of post-production just to get the sound right and and edit a little bit for Salter's or stumbles or anything? This is just going to be a raw recording now granted. It's into a great microphone. So hopefully it sounds good. But this is a real recording and I'll tell you the point of it. So the point of it was that this is the holiday season and no matter where your where you live a country you live in what city you live in what state what your religion is. It is or your beliefs are because it is such so well known for being a holiday season, even if you don't celebrate the holidays, this can be a very trying time for some people. It can be a very lonely experience for some people or sad or lonely. I think I just hit that or it can just be like a bla kind of feeling not necessarily depressed, but just kind of feeling blah. and or there's plenty of people there are plenty of people who are feeling hopeful right now going into 2020 and I would encourage anyone to listen if you want to listen, but this really this episode which I have absolutely zero idea what I'm going to talk about right now, but this episode I wanted to be for those who get it who get that that feeling because although I don't Feel that way right now. I feel quite optimistic and happy and almost content. I never feel fully content because I get a little scared. When I do I do I I have felt that way in the past especially around certain holidays, and I know a lot of people can feel that way. So this is actually just like a special episode for you if you if what I've said in the last few. In its resonates with you if you can can recognize what I'm talking about then you this is for you. If it doesn't if it feels like I don't know what you're talking about or I don't feel that way. Then I'm going to do something. I don't normally do until you that you probably shouldn't listen to the rest of the episode because it really isn't going to be that interesting. And so I mean it's not meant to be interesting. It's meant to be Kind of compare companion for you companionship for you. If you're not feeling well, like I remember when I was like a young teenager like 13 to 15. I was in a Janet Jackson fan club, and I still know a lot of friends from it. And in fact one of those friends Sarah it works for me at Backstage now, I mean, this has been 23 24 years and That friendship has lasted and others have Braun and Amy and others but I was in this fan club and it was the kind back in the day where you would write in you would write to pin Pals and and you would get this, you know, stickers and pins and all sorts of things. And one of the things that they had was you could call this phone number and you call the phone number and press one or two or three or four and when you press the number there would be like a minute long message from Janet and she would just say hey, it's Janet. Just wanted to let you know that I'm having a great year and I really appreciate you that kind of thing, you know, and I remember I would call that sometimes I call it originally just to hear it and then I would call it sometimes when I was feeling down and when I was feeling lonely or when I was feeling like I didn't have that many friends and Really? I still remember being in the my bunk bed had a red bunk bed, and I would I would sit on that and and and dial that number every once in a while and listen to her and it really made me feel better. And I've also been all around the place the past couple of years and especially the last six or so months with this podcast people everywhere I go no matter what city country I'm in is there some one or few or several people who will say that they listen to this podcast and they'll quote me from it. And it's like one of those things that's really deeply resonating in a way that tweets and Instagram posts and emails and even like magazines or are things of that nature can aren't and can't be I think the only thing that might rival it is when my book is released because The the book itself will be like this thing that you can reference if you get a physical copy or if you listen to it audibly so I know that there are some people who who listen to almost every episode or whoo. Yeah. Whoo, whoo would be getting something from this and again, I'm not going to edit it. It so I'm going to probably stumble a little bit and I'm actually responding to a text message right now. So just give me a moment just because this is happening in real time. And this is kind of an important one. Okay, so telling you it's real so yeah, I think they're going to be some people who are listening what I said to Anna before I came in here because I just I told her I'm going to come in here and I just said I'm going to I'll be gone for like an hour by and she's like, okay she gave me a hug and she said I'll see you soon. What I told her is that if 10 people feel a little bit less alone. Maybe you don't feel lonely. But a little less alone in the world today as you listen to this somewhere in the world. Then I have completely accomplished my goal and with this podcast and it is absolutely worth every minute of my time. So which Is time time is money and we talked about top just trying to think about what would be interesting to talk about like I'm again, if you're if you're trying to listen to this for anything that will help you with your business or help you succeed in 2020 and all that. I don't think this is the one for you. So you might want to hit the stop button, but this is more like if I called you up and we just start hanging out on the phone. And so it's a Bit like ASMR, but not at all. Okay, let's see some going to be on I'm on Twitter. It's Monday. It's the day before Christmas Eve. It's like right before noon. I've ordered food from door - and it'll be here soon. I'll go and eat it soon and I'm what I'm reading right now on Twitter is I posted I posted a post about an hour ago hour or two ago where I gave Shout out to Mark Cuban the owner of the Mavs billionaire investor who's on star star Shark Tank. I don't know if there's anybody in the u.s. At least who doesn't know Mark Cuban, but maybe outside of the u.s. He's he's not as well known but he he lives in Dallas and I'm from Dallas and we met so I'll tell you what the Tweet was and then I'll tell you how we met. So the Tweet says thank you Mark Cuban this year after learning that I was having trouble raising more funding he Quietly offered me a million dollars to invest how I see fit. He also met with backstage Capital Founders remembered my mother's name and did a video Drop for my brother's Dallas Media company and then he replied to that and said that I earned I earned that and that my family is fun and Etc. So there's been a lot of play on that on that tweet and one right before it was kehlani because I was talking to kehlani again. Kehlani is a singer. Performer, she's also the co-founder of a company called Flora Flora living and backstage my fund has invested in her company like three years ago. I think now wow, that's crazy. And yeah, I think it was three years ago. I'm pretty sure and she has like a top-five song right now and she was saying like this is crazy and I was like, it's a lot of hard work. To come to come to review fruition. It's manifesting itself because I'll tell you this quick story and then and then I'll go back to Cuban. So I have a hairdresser in Los Angeles and I found her. She's like Kim Kimble's salon, and I found her because I used to live right across the street from that Salon in West Hollywood. So I lived there for two years and then I moved and I kept her because and I'm not saying her name just cuz I don't know if she'd want me to but I kept her because because she was great and I remember when I was in Chair once a kalani's music came on at the salon and I said hey, do you know that person and she's like, oh, yeah. No kehlani and I just was so excited because we had just invested in her. So I told her and she said that years before that so that would have been two thousand Seventeen or eighteen that that conversation was happening. She said that years before that just a few because kehlani is probably early 20s at this point. But when you Kalin was a was a teenager this hair A dresser who also does Mary J. Blige is hair does a lot of people's hair has done Beyonce's in the past has done part of her team, you know, because there's several that are needed. She was called in by by a producer to help style groom a couple of up-and-coming artists on that producers label and kailani was one of them. And the other was like more more had more heat behind them. They were doing better as far as like people like labels looking at them or getting more plays or however you measure that I just remember that my hairdresser said that the other group was who they were focusing on the most and kailani was being focused on but it was going to be like a slow burn basically. So what she noticed about Kalani though. Is that kehlani she found out that kehlani it? Took her like two buses to get to the studio every day. And so she took these two buses and that when she got there. She was always on time. She was always courteous to everyone. She was always ready prepared for what job work. She had to do that day and it really caught the attention of this hairdresser because she was like, this is someone who is doing it, right and that kind of craftsmanship and that kind of attention and And dedication usually pays off as we all know as we all know. So today kailani, I've seen her perform a she broke all kinds of records at Pride a couple of years ago where they had like, they couldn't let people in after a while because it was so packed for her. She broke the record for how many people would come to see her at La Pride which was tens of thousands of people it was incredible. And so I've seen her I was upset standing on the stage when that happened and it was Just amazing and I've seen are different places and people they don't just come to see her they live and breathe with her is a very loyal fan base. But apparently I think based on just like the momentum. I think this is going to be 20 20 is going to be K Lonnie's year. I really do. I thought that the past three years haven't been her years, but this one's going to be it because it's funny because I see her talking to people like rdb. Chief was featured on a cardi B song called ring on the latest album, which is one of my favorites from the album. So she's featured and everything. But you see her talking to cardi B, and it was like she knew cardi back in the day and was friendly with her and helpful to her back in the day and then cardi blew up and then the same thing I'm seeing is happening with Liz. Oh Liz. Oh is saying hey you were there for me back in the day and now Liz I was blowing up in 2000. So 2018 was Cardis year. 2019 was Liz's year. I'm going to go ahead and say 2020 is going to about to be kalani's year and it's just really exciting to see and fun to see so going back to Cuba. Mm. So March of 2019 this year. I I met Mark Cuban at South by Southwest which is a major Festival in Austin. It's a all kinds of some music festival. It's a film festival. It's an interactive Festival which is like Tech. And Innovation, it's education Festival. It's is one of the largest in the world and it was I was speaking a few times this year there and one of them was at Twitter house, which was a bar big bar that Twitter took over and had different interviews. And so this one was Mark Cuban and I interviewing each other because it was Twitter house. They were looking for people who use Twitter and interesting way and they said that the two of us are outspoken and authentic and we'd probably get along and kind of feed off of each other's energy and they were right. I definitely had a great time and it was funny because when we went out when we walked out, everybody was chanting marks named Mark Mark heart. You know what I was like hey, how you doing? Yeah, it's me. No one knows me here. And then by the time we left people were like high-fiving me as I left and saying my name was I walked out. It was really funny. But I would I notice then was that Mark was super cool. Here's what here's the funniest thing about this whole time with Mark that that day. So Mark is a billionaire. He's from Dallas. I grew up in Dallas. I've known about Mark Cuban. My almost my whole life because of Shark Tank and but before Shark Tank just because he was this Dallas billionaire and he has a lot of street cred, you know, so my brother likes him and so it's just like that thing. So I'm expecting Mark Cuban to have to roll deep to have an Entourage to have an assistant at the very very least, but certainly to have security with him. And unless these people were stealth and they were like hidden on purpose because of whatever reason they did not exist and they probably right now that I think about it. He probably does have security that is that is not seen because that would be the smarter way to do it. But anyway, the point of it was like behind the scenes and backstage. He had nobody with him. He wasn't being fussed over and he wasn't making a fuss and I came in with my mom my brother because my mom was visiting. My brother was filming professionally for me my makeup person who also was doing grooming and and then and I Security I had security at this place because I had a stalker at the time. It's a whole thing. I don't want to really get into because I don't like to talk about that. But at this particular time I had security so I had like five five for five people with me and Mark Cuban had zero and so it was really funny it to me. It was very it's one of those things that I find great humor in the absurdity of things and that was it. So we go go out. We have a really good time really good conversation. And and that was that he talked to my mom a little bit and it was really friendly and got a picture with my brother who is just so stoked about that because he had been paying attention to the Mavericks for half his life. And that was that and then a couple things happened where it it was kind of I had to we had a couple of like investors back out of something this year and It's like putting it mildly but I don't want to go back into it and he found out and you know, there was a lot of money that was lost but he got in touch with me because you know, let me just back up a little bit like right after that. I sent him a message on Twitter like a DM and I was like, hey Mark, do you want to invest in backstage? And he is like no, I don't like to invest in funds because I like to have too much fun investing directly into company. So that's not really my thing. I don't invest in other people's of funds if I can help it. I was like, okay, you know, that's fair I get that a lot that to me is completely legitimate because people have different structures and the way that like models of how they spend their money and I do too so that wasn't his jam and I could understand it. And so I was like, okay cool. And then I just kind of moved on and then this sort of thing happened with the money not coming through and people writing about it and it was like all these people are kind of coming down on me at once. I felt pretty bad. Head and all of a sudden Mark reaches out just on his own he sent me he did he I sent me a DM on Twitter and he's like hey and he didn't ask anything. He didn't like challenge me. He didn't say why didn't you make this work? He just said hey, why don't you invest a million of my dollars and establish even more of a track record with it, and that'll be that and I'm telling you like we basically lost like 30 million dollars. But so the 1 million wasn't that but let me tell you it's just like the first time that Susan can ruin an angel investor gave me $25,000 September 2015 when I had been hearing no from everybody for three years about the fund $25,000. I've raised 1112 million since then, but I'll never ever forget the 25 and there will be nothing will be as valuable as that 25 when it comes to. Fund so for him to reach out knowing that he does not enjoy investing in other people's funds while he was away. He hacked that was that it's a KO fits a partnership. It's his money. I invested but it's not like a pooled fun. Like the rest of them are so it's under it's under my name. It's called Arlen was here Investments fund one. I plan on having several more in different ways, and I invested in 12 companies from it. It this year for five of them? I had already invested in and we just went back and we have the other half. We just were the other two thirds. We just invested in new companies, and I know that it's going to have a return so I know it'll be able to literally pay him back, but I don't know if I'll ever be able to pay him back for that the generosity of spirit that collaboration that what I've said to him and he won't let me kind of like he won't just let me Say it he kind of it's not like he has this humility because we all know Cuban doesn't have a lot of humility, but it's more like I won't even let you do that. But basically he took me seriously, they're very so there are a lot of people like I put this tweet out a few days ago, and I said, I'm going to paraphrase. I think I said like beware the people who would have you like lets you let you take hits take the hits, but don't trust you enough to be quarterback. And for me, that's what I'm thinking when I think Cuban like Cuban he wants me to be in the trenches, which I already have been for years. He had to learn that a little bit. It's like oh, okay. I didn't realize you had been doing all this. He wants me to be in the trenches, which I have been. Thankfully. He wants me to take the hits and and and kind of like, you know, earn my keep and all of that which is cool. Whatever it's like a Miyagi thing, but he also so has proven this already to me behind the scenes. He also values my opinion. He values my value if that makes sense. He doesn't look at it. Like he's this white knight coming in to save the day. He's like make me some money make me some additional money and to me that is That is worth more than any amount of money. Is that is that taking you seriously part so I kind of measure relationships that way these days I measure them in are you going to get my just here to take your hits take the hits for you? It is is or can I can I make some decisions and the reason I tweeted that by the way, I'll switch gears and tell you why I tweeted that because that one resonated with people too and I think people found their own meanings in it. It which was great. It's what I wanted but the meeting that I took it from was there are people who I'm not gonna get too specific because there's at I want to keep this pretty light, but there are people who will take pictures with. Certain people for the clout but I know that they wouldn't take them seriously business-wise that makes sense. That makes sense. I don't know. I don't know if you can make sense without me going deeper and I don't want to delve deeper into it. So that's what it is. So like don't don't pat me on the back online. Don't give me a shout out online. So there buddy can see it but then when I you know behind the scenes say hey, can you look at this? Deal with me there. You don't don't say like oh, well, you know, I don't that's not that's not going to work because I don't trust you to be on my level in your actions were saying that that's not going to work for me. So that's happened. Of course. All right, I'll move on to different topic before I get it myself too much in the weeds with it. But so that's what I was doing. So I was looking at and let me see where the food is. So it's exactly new now and see where that food is. I'll tell you what door - I used or - quite a bit. Oh, look The Food arrived I use it quite a bit because I'm always traveling and it's better than Hotel food and I use it at home because since I'm always traveling I get home. The last thing I want to do is cook and I definitely need to like I definitely need to like figure out a little bit better solution but I use it so, you know how Spotify had the end of year or like, you know or end of decade? I think this is this is the this Our top five listens and everything well door - if you are door - user you probably got that email that says this is how much you let me tell you what it was called and now felt so attacked it said this is how much you ate this year go God I was like, wow, that is thanks door - come at me. Come at me. Why don't you admit it? And I open up the the number and yeah, I think there were trying to make you happy and trying to get you to press something so you could order more but when you send and you kind of show people how much they consumed in a year, I don't know if it has the effect you're trying that you're going for the effect it had on me was I took a break for a couple days and like I don't even want to look at the app. I don't even want to guess what's over there, you know. So it's funny that just the kind of psychological stuff that that does but let's look so now I'm going to go to Instagram if you're still listening. I'm glad you are and I'm happy to be hanging out with you. All right? Yeah. So Instagram, I have a couple couple new messages I get like so I got a few like I get I don't know how many anymore I used to count like I used to. To know just have an understanding of it but I get like a few thousand messages a per week across email DMS on social LinkedIn slack slack is different because you can't really kind of the same but like the ones that need attention, you know, so combined I get just so many of them, but I pay attention to them pretty much. And I got I try to reply when I can and when I can't or when it feels like I shouldn't I don't these are things that you learn at 39 in 38 38. You don't you'll learn them earlier. I don't think because I did not I did not understand boundaries of time before very recently. So don't feel bad. If you're not great at it. Yep, and if you are greeted it good for you and spread it around share that with someone. So, let's see the last thing on Instagram. So Marlon was here on Instagram and Twitter if you're not And you'd like to I am on both so looks like okay. So the last thing I posted a couple of hours ago again was that just a screenshot of the Mark Cuban tweet and that has a lot of a lot of Buzz around it. And then the one before that was yesterday. I did diversity stats. I probably post on Twitter I can post up to like 20 times a day anywhere from 2 times a day to 20, I think. On Instagram, I post zero to two times per day. I don't usually do more than two and less it's just outrageous stuff going on because I it's like a strategically it's not that I strategically put up anything but I strategically look at how like the pace of Instagram because I don't I don't want to just post anything. That's what the Instagram stories are for. That's what I post a lot of so I'm talking about the timeline when that 0 to 2 on the on the stories. I'll A post multiple times are I'll go a few days without posting. I don't have a huge game plan there. I probably will in 2020. I'll probably get a little bit better at that. But what has served me well so far in life has just been to be true to myself be authentic post when I feel like posting post what I feel like posting. Delete what I want to delete when I want to block when I want to mute conversations. When I want to mute people when I want to all of those things have really served me. Well, especially in the last couple of years like when I started muting conversations on Twitter and muting people You know, I'll block a person real easy real fast because that self-care blocking is self-care quote me, please but muting is a little tough because you like sometimes blocking and people you don't want to block them because you like they didn't do anything wrong. They're just it's just not a helpful to me to have them have their noise in my in my life and I could be that to someone else which I would understand. So I love the mute feature because the mute feature is just like I don't need to hear about what you're Wayne or what your opinions are if it's if it's a negative to me and have a lot of people I keep a lot of people who have dissenting opinions who have opposite opinions of mine. I keep them on because I don't ever want to be in a bubble too much but I do want to be protected. I think a bubble and a cocoon or two different things. I don't want to be in a bubble where I'm only hearing the same thing too that I think people are. Are preaching to the choir people hate Trump and and that's it. And there's no there's no Nuance to it. No color to it. I don't want that. But I want to be in a cocoon where I don't where I feel comforted where I feel like I'm not constantly being thrown the this visceral that is thrown about in Social and I've had it, you know, the more the more followers you have or the more Post that have over a thousand likes or whatever the more you get this incredible disgusting vitriol that comes out from people from Bots from actual people from where it from people you some people, you know, all of that and I'm protect myself from that at all costs and I encourage others to do that, too. Yeah, and I'm trying to keep an eye on things so that I don't ever Get to disconnected where I can't feel I can't feel for someone else or I can't relate to someone else. I feel pretty confident that that won't happen. At least for a few years. Give me a few years and I may just become just unreasonably obnoxious, but still got a few years and speaking of 2020 speaking of being unreasonably unreasonably obnoxious in 2020. You're going to see a lot more of me. Now. If you think you see too much of me today, which I imagine if you've listened this far you probably aren't one of those people who like likes to tell me that I'm everywhere and to many places. But if you think you see me too much today, hold on to your hats folks because 2020 is when my book comes out and man. You can't you can't get away from marketing for a book and I don't want to I'm so cited about it. I have a book. I finished a book co-wrote. I don't know if it's co-writing like it's see what we call it. So it's my book with with a ton of help from Rachel Nelson who gets a credit on it as she should and yeah, it's going to be out there. It's going to be out there. I can't wait. This is what I'm looking forward to because I've had this experience before I know how cool it is. I cannot wait to see it pop up at an airport where I'm traveling and it's at the airport. So the way that that happens is that it can be at the airport in general. But usually it's because it's selling well other places. So that is one of the reasons a pre-order is so important and I encourage people to order it early just because then more airports will ask for it and It'll be seen by strangers because I'm excited. I'm equally excited to show it to people who have been following me who know me, even my family and friends. I can't wait to see what their opinions of the book will be and everyone that thousands of people have been following this journey for the past few years including you right now. I cannot wait for you to tell me. What you think and and most importantly get something out of it that you can use in your life that helps you so I can't wait to hear those stories of how the book helps you do something. That's like the ultimate at the same time. I can't wait to meet new people because of the book. So if you're walking in the airport and you see this cover and it's like it's about damn time. What is that about and you pick it up and you read it or you see me on some sort of interview or something and you are at a speaking event at a conference. You never heard of me, but I speak for a few minutes and you were interested all of those things bringing you to the book. I can't wait for because that's going to be I think that'll be super trippy. And so many of my friends are my in my acquaintances recently have released books or have had books out before been giving me great advice and Preparing me as much as possible what I don't think you get prepared for this and we'll see what happens to this little book. We'll see what happens. I can't wait. I can't wait and honestly just like this episode if it if it true I know this is so trite but it's not meant to be if it truly helps just a few people if it truly helps you helps you start a company helps you feel like you can ask for promotion helps you feel like you can become. The CEO of your destiny basically then I'm just going to be elated so I can't wait to meet people and have those conversations and that's just a little bit about how I'm thinking in those terms. Yeah, so, it's Monday. It is tomorrow's Christmas and I think we're going to release this today. I think I'm just going to upload it and release it which is not normally what I do because I yeah. See only I've been rambling. So I have no idea if it's good or not, but I'll upload it today, which is Monday right before Christmas Eve. And then I was supposed to go to the beach with my wife this week, but it started raining and it's supposed to rain a few days this week so we decided not to go so I'll be at home and I'll be watching more monk yesterday. I watched four episodes of Monk the day before that. I watched like five episodes of Monk. They're all been like saved on my DVR because it like airs every Thursday or something like that Sunday or something a few of them. So today I'm going to watch more monk. I plan on watching at least two episodes of Monk today, which probably means five. I love that show, I grew up with my mom watching Murder She Wrote and Perry Mason she grew up with my mom watching like Murder Mysteries and Westerns and and soap operas. So today what do I love mysteries like monk old school stuff like Perry Mason. I'll still watch that at night every once in awhile. I love westerns love it and Andy Griffin. I love The Rifleman is my favorite Western because it's amazing and I heard Chuck Connors was really cool when he was alive, and it's just a great great show and I think he was reincarnated as the lead guitarist on the S&L band Saturday Night Live band for like the 90s and 2000's. It's a whole different story if you feel like hey go search for that person to play guitar at breaks from like 92 2005 or something. I don't even know the dates, but he looked just like Chuck Connors Chuck Connors from the right from it. Anyway, I love that and I love Bonanza and all kinds of And then I'll of course General Hospital. I used to watch one hour to live when it was on and because it came on right before general hospital with General Hospital's it it is it and yeah. So anyway, I'm going to watch a bunch of TV. I'm going to eat my food that's already here. So I'm going to go and then check this out and do not send any spoilers once you hear this I am going. I cannot wait for this Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. I'm going to show my wife Ana. We got married in August. We've known each other for five more than five years. We've been dating for more than four years and I often introduce her a new movies because she's not a big movie person. She's a TV person. I am going to show Anna. Notting Hill for the first time that she's singing it Notting Hill is probably going to be Christmas Eve and Love Actually on Christmas Day for the first time getting to watch those two movies with someone who's never seen them before what more could you ask for? I can't wait I can't wait so we're going to watch that we're both being really creative this week this weekend. We were really creative and just we're not working. I mean, I'm not working. I'm at work. I'm on vacation. Get to read a lot and right and plan and watch a bunch of TV and think through strategies and it's just so fun and she's working on all sorts of stuff. She's doesn't work yet, but she's doing like all this creative stuff. So she has like a little lab and a separate room and she has like recording equipment and she can make all these she's making all this music and composing all this instrumental music. It's gorgeous. Amazing. I think she's going to be like very successful at that and she will be and she's also just working on all kinds of really interesting projects. So I'm going to go back to that world and I gave you about 40 minutes. I hope it was helpful to 10. That's all I'm looking for is ten of you. I know that thousands listen to the podcast would have just ten of you found yourself a little bit less alone. During the season and you normally feel that way. Please let me know but don't you don't even have to let me know. I don't need to know I just really want that for you and just know that again as corny as it may be really are not alone. I have been I'm 39 years old and I've attempted I'm sorry trigger trigger warning trigger warning trigger warning. You might want to skip over this for anything. I have in the past attempted suicide in my other teenager again in my late 20s. And I'm so so so so glad that both times. It didn't happen. I have been broke for most of my life. I've had no money. I've been sleeping on couches not sleeping staying overnight for days at a time just on the streets but not living on the streets but like walking the streets. Basically, I have slept at the airport as many many many times that's been said, it's true. I slept there for days and days and days and days and days and didn't have any food and was So worried and so depressed and literally face to the floor crying wondering when it was going to be over and I'm here right now. I am living in a building that I only could have dreamed of of just a few years ago. I have a view of Los Angeles that I've craved for most of my life ever since seeing it on television I have I raised and earned more than five million dollars this year alone for my company not for myself, but for my company. And I've raised more than 10 million the last four years five years ago five years ago. I was sleeping at the airport. A little less than a little more like a little more than five years ago a little less than five years ago. Sorry little less than five years ago. I was sleeping there for so four and a half years ago sleeping at the airport again, please don't try to sleep at the airport to impress me after do that little thing because you know how I mentioned earlier. There's like a stalker they did that. I didn't like it. Please don't do that, but going back to my point. I don't ever ever want to be back there again, but I survived it and you can survive what you're going through. I think I don't know what you're going through and a lot of it's going to be so much worse than what I've just described but some of its going to be better some of its going to be less odds against you and if I can get there I know you can. I just held on to hope I continue to work on what I knew I could have control of and there were people around me who came into my life just at the right time and I know they can do that for you. It took 35 years for me to really feel like I was doing something in the world and then I wasn't lost and spinning out of control and not really knowing. Self renewing my value at all 35 years. And today I feel all those things. I feel like I have control knock wood. I feel like the only thing I can't control this health and they can't other people's health or like things that I can control how I eat and exercise but I can't control things that think like that but to go from so much adversity and I just scratched the surface really scratch the surface with that explanation to go M to here where I can control my day. I can control who I talked to who I give time to I can control I was playing Black Santa earlier this week. I went online and I gave away a bunch of gifts to help people do different things strangers. That's so much fun. I think you can get there too. And hey if you're someone who has money and that part is not the problem that part's not tough for you. You get to feel down to you're allowed to feel bad, too. And I mean so many people who feel bad for feeling bad when they have money. They're not supposed to feel down because they have enough they can eat every day. They're not homeless. They're not this to not that you're human. You're a person. You're allowed to feel bad. Sometimes it's okay as Jessie J says, it's okay not to be. Okay go listen at song right now. We're all allowed. We're allowed to brag we're allowed to feel proud. We're allowed to feel shame. We're allowed to feel guilty and guilt were allowed to feel sad down depressed hurt disappointed content. Happy elated optimistic all of us. All of us are so I wish you well and go listen to some music that you like go. Watch some TV that you like go talk to someone give someone a call. If you happen to listen to this and you weren't in a bad mood, you just like my voice call somebody up call a friend up call a family member up even if they are always seeming hmm seems like they're good. Call them up this this week. Calma. All right, I'll see y'all I hope you're doing well.

Teske talking about some course creation kit tips for Mario Maker. There is a giveaway for a really cool-looking Nintendo switch and new Tetris information is on its way those stories and more on this episode of Nintendo switch craft. This is smash block and you're listening to Nintendo switch craft. witchcraft is brought to you live four times a week on Tuesdays Thursdays Fridays and Saturdays tuning live over at twitch.tv slash run jump stomp this Sawdust witchcraft is made possible by patrons like you gets Witchcraft and my other content ad free for as little as a dollar over at patreon.com run jump stop before we go any further. Usually I say which Patron it is, but right now patreon is down. I can't get to patreon at all. And then that's really where there's actually quite a few websites. I can't get to I wasn't able to go see Nintendo life. I couldn't get to patreon Discord crashed on me. So I don't know what's happening. But it seems like it's the end times. Anyway, I wanted to talk just a little bit about patreon because I know that there's a lot of people who don't like patreon like in general like they are not a fan of patreon overall and I did have somebody who said bill. I want to support the show. How do I do that? I don't want to support patreon and I was like, well first off just listen to the show that's enough. But if you're looking for other ways to support the show one way that I don't think I've ever spoken about and that's because I just never got around to talking about it is you can support the show just like you do on patreon but directly through anchor. So if you go to Anchored on FM / NSC that's and as a Nintendo S as in switch and C as in Tanker dot f m / NSC there is a button right there that says support this podcast. And if you click on that, it pops up a little spot where you can subscribe for a buck a month five bucks a month or 10 bucks a month. So just the I always forget to talk about it because people ask me and then I send them a message about it, but I never talked about it on the show other ways that you can support Nintendo switch craft, but because I couldn't go to patreon this morning and Find the name of the patron for today's episode. I did it just kind of reminded me. So if you want to help out, that's awesome. There's another way you can help out as well. And this one is really important. Okay? This one doesn't cost you anything except for maybe about five minutes of your time. Alright, so if you want to help out and you've got five minutes last year Nintendo switch craft was nominated. And for the podcast Awards and it's just very I was like blown away that I was nominated for an or we did not win. That's okay. I was just very happy to be nominated. But the podcast Awards is now accepting nominations again. So, you know, if you want to nominate Nintendo switch craft, it would really like the the they only take the top 10 of P of They get nominated and those are the ones that are in the category so nominations, I guess are now open.

So then you'll also be able to vote on the the winners as well. So then you check that. Listener you hit sign up and then you can nominate Nintendo switch craft for a podcast award and you know, it would be amazing if we won, but I would just love to be nominated again. So that's another way that you guys can help out. It would really really help. So anyway podcast towards.com, but that's not what you're here to listen to your here to hear about Nintendo stuff. So let's talk about all of the things that are going on with Nintendo. But first I want to thank Scott Mayhew. And for their five star review on Apple podcast, you get everybody who reviews the show over there. You guys are awesome. Thank you so much. Let's let's talk about Cadence of Hyrule Mario is an Italian plumber who under your control enters the Mushroom Kingdom to fight off killer turtles and deadly Ducks until he can Rescue the Princess Toadstool. All right. That was the wrong clip. It should have played Zelda stuff. It's just random. It doesn't matter Cadence of Hyrule. I About last time just a little bit. I got through to the first boss and I was able to beat the first boss. They did it on stream over at my twitch stream and it was awesome. It was really really fun. I am now at the second dungeon, so I have been I've continued playing and I've worked my way through and now I found the second dungeon and I am running into a problem. Like I just can't seem to get past it the difficulty of Cadence of Hyrule is really really high and it's high enough that I've even considered turning on. I haven't done it yet. But I've considered turning on the mode where it you don't have to do it to the beat of the music everything just kind of moves when you move so you can like move link or Zelda or Cadence and or whatever the the necrodancer 's name is you can move those characters. And every time that they move every other monster on the level moves and then you can stop and look and say okay. This guy's got his arm up. So he's going to swing and this guy is about to cast a spell and you know, all of those that like that kind of stuff like you can make all of those decisions and then decide where am I going to move next in move move to that next square and I feel like that kind of takes away a lot of the The charm of the game so I don't want to play like that. But right now I am just absolutely slamming my head against a wall trying to figure out what am I doing wrong? Because I can't like I keep missing beats or they'll be too many monsters clustered into an area and so I can't find a way to dance around them so that I can get my attacks off without getting hit myself. I was talking to somebody about this they said bill Leave the dungeon and just go look around and try and farm diamonds and farm other stuff go find extra hearts and things like that so that you have more life because that's going to be that's going to help you quite a bit. So I may end up doing that but I I gotta say I love this game but it is it might be beyond my skill level which is too bad. But you know, I finished the first And you can do the dungeons in any order. So I finished a dungeon. Maybe I just finished an easier dungeon. And this one seems harder. It's the ice dungeon, by the way, so I'm having a lot of trouble with it, but I'm going to keep plugging away and keep trying and I'm going to resist the urge to turn off the fixed beat mode so that I return on the fixed beat mode so that I don't have to worry about dancing to the beat of the game. I think that that That I think that that kind of defeats the purpose of playing this game and if that's what I was going to play then I would just play some other roguelike even though this one has noodles and Oodles of charm. Okay, let's let's let's talk about Super Mario maker to I have to cough real quick. Just a second. All right. Sorry about that. So I want to talk about Super Mario maker to that game game is awesome. Yeah, I can't wait until we can play with our friends, but I'm having an absolute blast playing Super Mario maker to now just so everybody knows if you go to run jump stop.com. Mmm as in Mario Maker you can submit your levels that you make to this. Spreadsheet which will have a bunch of people's levels on it. I don't know. How many are in there. Now. Let's actually check. Let's go run jump stomp stomp.com. Mmm. Sorry for the typing sounds and what you'll see when you get there. You'll go to my website and it'll you'll scroll down and we'll have a big picture that says Super Mario maker to you click on that and it's going to take you to a Google form where you can submit your information right now. We've Five only only five things in there, but that's okay because we're going to get more and you can also shoot I didn't mean to do that. Let me click home. I screwed that up. / mmm. I didn't mean to close it. And then what you can do is if you go to MMM you can bring up the list and it has all of the level IDs listed right there. I will tell you this one the first one level names stuff by Johnny link is is really really difficult and you're going to have a hard time finishing that one but it was fun to try Johnny link also said that his next one was going to be easier. So, you know, hopefully more people get in there and post their favorite and it doesn't even have to be one that you made it could be one that you just played and liked and you are sharing it with the community. So like that might be something that I do as well where if I play one on I really like it then I'm going to It into the Google form so that people can access these levels and have fun with it because Mario maker to it is just improves upon Mario Maker one in every possible way outside of the fact that there's no amiibo. Like I like the idea that you could put an amiibo in there and it would give you access to play as you know, the Splatoon kids or whatever. I thought that was cool that being taken away I think is Kind of lame, but at the end of the day, it really doesn't matter. I've been playing mostly As toad because what you can do is you can go in I think yeah, I think on every type of game you can go in and you can say I want to play as either Mario as Luigi as toad or is Toadette and I've been picking towed his little 8-bit Sprite is hilarious and I like playing as him, but Mario maker to is fantastic. I It's so much fun the hundred course chant or the endless course challenge. I think is beyond me. I like I always get like three or four into it and then I just hit a wall and I have this there's a problem with my brain where it's like you can't skip I mean if you skip then you're giving up and I don't like to skip if you didn't know you could just hold down the minus button on the controller for 3 seconds, and it will skip you to the next level I Eight skipping. So I end up not doing those endless course challenge where it just keeps giving you random courses, but I've been having a lot of fun just going into the core spot or another core spot the the course selector course world. That's what it's called and scrolling through and looking at one that has had lots of plays that it has lots of hearts on it and selecting it and going through and trying to beat it. I've just been having a blast with it the community Is very very good at making Mario levels. They're so much fun. And there's like the one of them that I did and I should probably try and find this and post it to the Run jump stop.com. Mmm, and I'm going to try and do that later on today. I'm pretty busy today though. I'm going to try and do that later, but it had this awesome boss fight where I got to the end and I had to fight Bowser. But the only way for me to defeat Bowser I was I was trapped inside a little box. Right and Bowser was off to the to the right and he was breathing fire at me and it just kept shooting mushrooms out to keep me alive. And then I had to do this weird dance with p-switches or I guess not piece which is just switches which kept turning blocks on and off in order to get like turtle shells. Has to fall down on Bowser in order to defeat him. It was incredibly clever and it came out of nowhere and I was really surprised when when it happened. I was just like that wasn't a fantastic boss fight and I did that over on my twitch stream and I think I think everybody was pretty impressed with that particular level. So like if there's more like that out there we are in for a real tree now my question is Are there levels in Mario Maker? I'm sorry Mario maker to that came from Mario Maker one, and I haven't really thought about it until right now in the middle of telling you about it. I was just curious like I got the game on day one and I loaded it up and there are already like a bunch of levels. So I guess I'm wondering how did those all these levels get created so fast and I'm sure there's lots of people who have Mario maker and they you know, they started making levels right away. But do we have some levels from Mario Maker one? And if we do that's really really cool. I also I'm very happy with the filtration system. So you can go through and filter out. You know, I don't want to do these music levels right don't want to do speedrun levels. Although the speedrun levels are have turned out to be my favorite swear. you go through and I didn't know this but you can say OK, you'll get 20 seconds to finish this level go and you keep going through and the first one that I did I didn't realize it was a speed run level and I went through and I got right to the end and I wasn't fast enough and I died and I was like, oh my God, I'd had no idea the speedrun levels might be my favorite levels, but you can filter out the stuff that you don't like and just focus drill down on in into the stuff that I really do like and I just think that that's fantastic Mario maker to is a treat. It is an absolute treat. I can't wait for us to be able to play together. Once we get that patch, you know, who knows when that's going to happen. Hopefully sooner rather than later. Mr. Tezuka. He has five course creation tips for Super Mario maker to if you want to follow a link in the show notes, you know. Some of them are okay, whatever. He's like come up with a title first. It's really not that compelling content. But you know, you know, this is the guy who he's been making Mario levels for a very very long time. So the five course creation tips from mr. Tezuka as over on Nintendo's YouTube channel, and if you just go to run jump Stomp.com and this is episode 359 you will see a link in the show notes for that.

They make some really really great games. They make the steam world games. So steamworld dig steamworld dig to steamrolled Quest steamworld Heist. Is that everything they make awesome games and I'm a fan of image inform games. They have become one of my favorite developers on the Nintendo switch our or just in general just this cool Indie developer that they're putting out. Really really good content and they tweeted out today. They said it's summertime and we're giving away this custom golden steamworld Nintendo switch retweet and reply with your favorite steamworld memory will choose a winner and when we're back from vacation in August will pop on social media every now and then happy summer and if you're watching the video, excuse me. Then you get to see this and if you're not follow the link in the show notes so that you can check out the tweet from them. But this thing looks really really awesome. So on the left Joy con you can see the character from the first steamworld dig game on the right Joy con. You can see the character from the second steamworld dig game and on the back you can see characters from steamworld Quest and I don't think I see any steamrolled Heist stuff on here, but that's okay. Even then he said Nintendo switch logo has been changed on this. So it looks like we're there. You know how it's got like the black Joy icon in the white Joy icon and then they have the opposite colors in the and the switch logo. They've replaced the joy cons the like the thumbsticks the circles that are usually there with little Cog Wheels. It's just really cool and it looks like it's done. With metallic gold paint just really really awesome. I I am of course going to enter this contest and I'm sure that I won't win but somebody's going to win this thing. And I you know, if it's you I hope that you message me and let me know that you won because that thing is just so cool. And honestly, if you haven't played any of the steam World Games you're missing out on a some fantastic games and they're from all different genres. So for instance, if you're looking for a game that is a tactical game turn-based tactical then you want to check out steamworld Heist. It's basically like XCOM or Mario plus Rabbids, but in the steam World Universe where you are like these robots who are on a spaceship and you're going from place to place and fighting against like space pirates and stuff like that. It's really awesome. If a metroidvania game is more your jam then check out steamworld dig in. Steamworld dig to those games are ridiculously good especially steamworld dig to it's one of my favorite metroidvania has of all times. So definitely check that out. And then if you're looking for an old-school jrpg where they kind of Base the combat on having cards in your hand, you're like, okay. Well, I've got these cards. I'm going to use this card and it uses up my Mana then steamrolled Quest is going to be something that you're going to want to check out and if If any of those games sound cool just go to my YouTube channel youtube.com slash run jump stop and I bet you if you type in Steam world. I don't know if I've done stuff for all of them, but I've done stuff like I've done videos on some of them. So if you just type in Steam World on my YouTube channel, you will find those videos and you can check out what the steam world games are all about their they all have a really cool aesthetic. I love the art. And there are also just really good examples of the genre that they're in so that's image inform games there, you know, hopefully, you know fingers crossed. I hope I win but I doubt I will but anyway, let's talk about something else that I'm never ever going to win. And that's Tetris 99 the highest place that I've ever gotten on Tetris 99 is second place and I was very happy to get there but they keep having these Tetris 99 online competitions, which I think are very cool. The last one gave you the ability to unlock like a Game Boy style theme for Tetris 99 and all you really had to do is at worst play a play like 50 games. Nobody's going to have to play 50 games in order to unlock that or nobody had to that would mean that you had to come in last place every single time. What was it? Oh, yeah. Yeah. So the higher you place the more points you get and then though you once you earn a hundred points, you unlock the whatever it is in the case of last time. It was a my God. My brain stopped working. It was a theme for for it via Game Boy this time. It is a instead of a Gameboy theme. It looks like it is a Tetris or I'm sorry, not a Tetris theme. Splatoon theme. So this is coming to us from a tweet from nin switch news, which was actually talking about something from Nintendo everything but I followed it to the original source. And this is a Nintendo's Japanese website and I'm scrolling scrolling scrolling and here it is right here. So this is the fifth Tetris Maximus cup. It's called the splits. Tune collaboration festival and it says Nintendo switch on in this is automatically translated. So it's going to be really broken English and stuff. But it says Nintendo switch online for member on love limited software in commemoration of the final Festival, which if you didn't know we're coming up on the final DLC for Splatoon to which I think is July 12 are no Yeah, I think it's July 12th. They're also doing a collaboration with Tetris 99 During the period the in-game graphics will change to splatoon's style and the theme of Splatoon collaboration will be will be presented to all those who earn a hundred points that can be earned according to the ranking during the rank period so please try it again. This is auto translated. So it's really hard to get. You're saying but the I already kind of covered the gist of it if you like Tetris 99 if you're a fan of Splatoon, and if you want to try and earn that then you're going to want to do that and it happens on July 12 starting at 4 p.m. I'm not sure if that's it's probably Japan time and it goes until July 16th when looks like 350. Nine PM. Also Japan time. Now are we going to be able to do this in the states or in Europe or in in the other areas? I don't know because I don't I haven't seen anything about this from Nintendo Europe. I haven't seen anything about this from Nintendo America. However in the past from with Tetris 99, they've kind of duplicated their efforts they call them different things, but they duplicate their efforts and Same all over the place. So I fully expect that. We will see something from Nintendo of America about this. However, it's free to make a Japanese Nintendo switch account. So all you had all you would have to do is log in with a Japanese account and then you could probably play this part and it's not like you have to be able to read anything when you're playing Tetris and my guess is you would probably be able to unlock this. Anyway, I'm definitely going to try because I love touch. There's 99. It's a fun game and you really don't have to play that many games in order to get those 100 points that they're talking about. Okay, Dragon Quest Builders to it has a demo out last time. I just mentioned that the demo was out and now I have played the demo. I did not play the entire demo. I played up to the point where you can save and you know, there's a lot of people who are confused about this. I wanted to address it and I think I could be wrong about this. But I think that they there's a good reason why you can't save Beyond a certain point. I think the game is generated procedurally so that when I'm playing and when you're playing we will have a different experience like the you all have all the same stuff but it would be in different places. At least that's what it seemed like from what I read when I was playing the demo because Cuz you start out you're on a boat with a bunch of monsters and the monsters are like, hey, dummy, go do all these things and it's basically teaching you how to play the game, which is great because I didn't play the first one and it's really cool. The thing that one thing that surprised me is you can go into first person mode and play in first person mode, which I thought that I would really like because I played a lot of Minecraft, but I actually prefer to play this in third person mode. It's much better the cameras up higher you can see more of the world and you Turn around faster as well. Because if you're playing in first person mode and you want to turn around like the character has to go to to to to to and turn all the way around. Whereas if you're playing a third person mode and you just point your stick the other direction your character just spins around instantaneously, but you will break stuff down you'll build things in a little crafting table like Minecraft you place blocks. It's basically Minecraft in a dragon. The universe and its really fun the the the quests and the text dialog is all super cornball, but it's also really charming and I liked it. So I had a lot of fun with Dragon Quest Builders to I'm not going to get it right away because I've just got too much to play but it's definitely something that I'm going to be watching to come out on a like on sale or something. Let's let's Going to skip this story about Layton and just let you know that the that there's a latent game called catch real the millionaire conspiracy deluxe edition coming to switch on August 11th. No, no, or is that November 8th? Yes, this is November 8th because that's Nintendo UK. So they they put their numbers backwards for that. So I just want to let you guys know about that. Let's I was going to do feedback. But what I'm going to do is I'm going to take that feedback and I'm going to throw that in a a light switch tomorrow instead just because we're already approaching a half an hour and I don't want to I don't want to go over time.

       " \"I decided to experiment by quitting social media to focus more on my own goals, away from comparing myself to others. I have had a revolutionary awakening now that I have let go of vices, and I embrace the process of finding and experiencing authenticity. Please email me at lucythorpsuell@lucythorpsuell.com for feedback/ topic suggestions. Lots of love. Hi, I am back. So I wanted to talk briefly about what authenticity looks like to me. So about two years ago. I decided to quit social media and I don't think there's anything wrong with it. It just wasn't working for me because I kept comparing myself to others. It was terrifying to depart from it, but Now that I'm coming up to two years without it. I just find myself more able to focused to focus. I mean and just more aligned with with my own personal specific goals. And so I say this because it might be a little hard to find me. I am going to be developing a website Lucy Thorpe school.com, but please just contact me at my email. It's LLC Thorpe. Th o RP @ gmail.com and and just let me know if there's anything that you would like for me to talk about. I will be bringing in some people to interview. There's some great people around the Houston Community and the recovery community and the spiritual community and I'm really really thrilled to get to bring them along. So anyway authenticity. What does that look like? You know, it's it's just it's being I'm me and not afraid to be me. I've been trying to please other people for so long. We're all trying to do that. But man once you can just let go of the external forces that are weighing ass down that sometimes that's that looks like drugs alcohol shopping gambling sex when we can let that all go and not cling to it and sit still enough to embrace our authentic selves something revolutionary happen. And I'm right on the brink of that and it feels so good and most importantly it feels so good to get to share it with you all because this is a collective struggle and collectively we can all help each other get to the light at the end of the tunnel because again there is that solution and let's just keep talking about the solution and let's help each other get there. It's such a beautiful life. It's such a beautiful day and I'm just really excited. To be here. So again email me. It's LLC Thorpe at gmail.com and give me some feedback. Let me know maybe who in Houston you would like me to interview. Let me know which topics you would like to cover because in this podcast we do get real and I am not afraid to cover even though I know my parents might be listening to this. I'm not afraid to uncover some gritty stuff. So Again, just email me. I'm looking forward to getting some responses and looking forward to Growing towards a solution together in a real way. Take care guys.\",\n",
       " \"In this meditation, we release a story (or many stories) that we tell ourselves. Overtime, our perception of something about ourselves or someone else can start to look like the truth when in fact it is not. The first step to changing our perspective is to see that we may be holding onto a story. My hope is that the Truth Tree does this for you today. \\xa0Release the story and bring in the truth.\\xa0 Hello and welcome to my daily meditation. My name is Jill and I do a live broadcast of my meditations on an app called Periscope where I do a video broadcast. And this is the audio version of that that meditation today's meditation is a really interesting one. I probably say that every time because I do this wrap up as soon as I finish meditation and I always like huh? I'm still in it myself. So today's meditation took us to a great tree.Times I see this tree in meditation. I think oh, it's the tree of knowledge. Sure. I've seen this tree before but this is very different this I've never been to this tree before. I've never seen this place before and this tree is actually called The Tree Of Truth and it absorbs truth and it gives truth. Well, this is very interesting. But we all know that we all have these stories that we carry around. I'm going to call them lies, but are are exaggerated truths in our bodies and we've told ourselves these things for so long that we start to believe them. So the point of this meditation today is to release to release this non. Truth is Li the Story that we tell ourselves and to bring in the truth to our bodies and you know, it does a couple of things releases attachment from this story that we it makes his conscious of it makes us aware that we that there is a story that we tell ourselves that it may not be true so that we can shift our perspective change your perspective you change a world. You can't expect other people to change. So this is the cell we do that the the other side of this is that That we bring truth in to our bodies. We so we release and we bring truth in and then we release something that we've been holding on to that maybe truth, but were not sharing it with anyone. So this could be a feeling that you have it could be something that's happened to you that you never shared but that to should have an What we're holding these thoughts these energetic thoughts in her body's they can they can manifest in a physical way without release. So this is a way to really let that go and release it into the tree. And continue to bring truths back. If you need to you need to stay there the whole entire meditation and just continue this release and bring in release and bring in and do that. I think this is a good meditation for that. So as always I hope it brings you. Peace. Homeless and a greater underwent awareness understanding yourself and wish you all the best and take a nice deep breath in all the way down to the belly expand that belly out and slowly exhale. Nice deep breath in and slowly exhale. last one deep breath in and slowly exhale good Alexa breath. Bring back the nice even flow through the body. Feeling that breath find a rhythm just like an ocean wave and I slow and steady Rhythm moves to the body. The breath comes in. The wave comes in breath goes out wave goes out. Relax your shoulders. Feel the relaxation with all the way down your arms to the ends of your fingers. Keep that breath moving nice and steady through the body. This is where you start to relax push all those external thoughts to the side where your mind focus focus is on the breath and you go into a deeper relaxed State girl your jaw. Relax is to just support you. No you to visualize yourself standing. and a path a rugged dirt path you feel yourself standing very firmly there. Feeling the sturdy ground underneath your feet fully supporting your body. Around you is just darkness. You don't say anything else. As your eyes follow the path in front of you. you'll notice that in the distance there's small source of light I want you to begin to walk towards that light feeling your feet rise and fall. Connecting to the Earth every step. You can't tell if you're in a cave or surrounded by dense trees. It's just darkness. As you walk farther down the path. He'll notice that the light becomes brighter. Until you finally emerge. This Darkness into the light. Where you're standing is not familiar to you. It's not a place you've been before. There are not a lot of trees around. in the distance Is One Singular great tree? Largest tree you've ever seen large roots coming up from the ground. I can only imagine how deep they go. Trunk of the tree would take several people wrapping its arms around it to measure its circumference. Its branches seem to reach the clouds. Our journey today is taking us to that tree. Where we seek truth? So continue your walk feeling your feet back to the ground with every step as you set your sights on the large tree. As you continue your walk you might be greeted by an animal. or several I want you to just observe they may cross your path or decide to walk with you. Stay the course and continue to the tree. once you get to the base of the tree I want you to walk around it. What you're looking for is a place that's worn from sitting from people coming to visit this tree. I can knock hidden in the rooms. Once you get there, I want you to find yourself. Nestling in making yourself comfortable. Feeling the support of this tree. sage and wisdom almost like you're absorbing it into your body. this tree Is the truth? It embodies the truth it absorbs the truth. It gives the truth. Today you're going to release old stories. Things that are not true things that we hold on to. We all have them. I want you to ask yourself where you're consciously. What is the thing I'm holding on to what is this story and wooly on to what is the lie? I'm holding onto Within Myself. This might be about someone else might be about you. Whatever that is. We're going to let it go and today. I want you to pull the first one that comes up when you ask that question yourself. We're going to do is we're going to pull that from our heart center energetically pull that out. Like it's a ball of black energy. And then the base of this tree in the dirt, we're going to bury it. Allowing the Earth to absorb that energy. to grow into something beautiful Now in that little Nook where you're sitting. And the small not in the tree. You didn't knock on the tree. And ask for a truth about yourself. You're going to hear this message. Anyway that you need to really feel it in your body or you hear it in your ears or is delivered to you in some beautiful way. That's very consciously for this truth. And allow for the response. Bring that truth Into Your Heart Center. breathe it in slowly exhaling allowing the Choose to absorb into the body. As We Lay Here in the neck of the tree Gonna Leave You for a little while. Just to enjoy being in the presence of the tree nestled in its roots cradled and loved. I'm soaring that truth into the body. I'll call you back when it's time. We're going. Give one more thing back to the tree. And that is a truth. That you're carrying. Maybe a burdensome truth. Something that you need to let go of her release. Something you can't hold it in anymore something you need to tell haven't found a way. Ask yourself what that is. Allow it to come up in your mind. We're not going to pull it from our bodies. We're going to sing it to the tree. Allowed so we can hear it. Stand up from this neck of the tree. placing your feet on the ground saying our goodbyes to the tree placing your hands on the trunk. We're just going to step back. walking away Keeping the view of the tree in our sides. Feeling our feet firmly on the ground. Go ahead and take a nice deep breath in. Slowly exhale bring your hands into Heart Center. Just take a moment for gratitude. Now formation for yourself. Maybe want to solidify some of those images in your mind. nice deep breath in slowly exhale When you're ready start to come back to me, go ahead and open your eyes.\",\n",
       " \"When Doc Brown invents a time machine, Marty McFly travels back to the past. However can he return to the present before it’s too late? Good afternoon, everybody and welcome to the first episode of throwback Thursday. This is a new segment on my podcast where we kind of go back in time for a little bit and we talked about old movies whether it's in the 20s the 30s were talking King Kong. We're talking The Good the Bad and the Ugly doesn't matter where it's from. It's like I said before I take many submissions. It's daily and I like to talk about these movies possibly every Thursday if I could and after careful consideration, there were a lot of great movies that you guys submitted first and foremost. Thank you. And there was this one submission that stood out and I figured you know, it was a it was a clever choice because a lot of people do ask for example. Hey, where do you get that name from? And I figured it's only best that I talked about 1985's Back to the Future which was recommended by none other than muscle Bob buff pants himself. I'm over here with a host for today. And that is Tristan wall oven. So for starters. I met Tristan about two years ago. I was roughly about two years ago, and he was pledging for Sigma Pi for most of you guys that don't know me too. Well. Yes, I was a frat boy, but now retired so now I like to play golf and walk on the beach all by myself in my free time. So without further Ado before we go into this review, I'd like to introduce muscle Bob himself and that's just in wall oven. So Tristan, go ahead and do your thing man. How are you doing today? I'm doing good Gilbert. Thank you for having me on your on your coveted podcast. I was very very very excited when you invited me to come on here and talk about Back to the Future which is You know a classic it's a one of those one of those Timeless movies where you know, regardless of what age group sees it or regardless of when you see it in terms of your own life, whether it be child teenager adulthood. It kind of just transcends through that and it's it's just a comedy for the ages. Literally, you know Back to the Future. So again, thank you for having me on here. No problem and and tell us a little bit about yourself. What's your what's your background? How did you get the name of muscle ball? So I came here after two years of playing college football and I decided I was a was time for me to give up the sport which is hard and but it really kind of built the foundation of of of my mindset and drive to sort of to train and to be be stronger. Just kind of improve on pain myself. So when I came here to Cal State Fullerton, the one thing that was missing from leaving football. And then the one thing that training was lacking by myself was a Brotherhood. So I joined Sigma Pi and I don't mean to brag or anything but I mean like it was it was a one of the best choices that could have made and from Sigma. II got got these these nicknames muscle buff pants all these all these all these crazy nicknames and so I just kind of stuck to my training entered and then dropped a couple bodybuilding competitions because they were sort of drop in my grades a little bit. But now, you know, I'm still training but now I'm focused on the bigger picture, which is a want to be being attorney. So I'm going to be going to law school next year and I'm going to take a What clerk office job and the coming months? So, you know got that in the works that was beautiful. So ladies and gentlemen, that is mr. Muscle Bob of pants himself. If you guys ever need to get out of a speeding ticket do not blow the cup you want to call Tristan wall oven and we will definitely take care of that. Alrighty now before we get into this review, what's what's one little fun fact that you wouldn't like our fellow listeners to know about you. It could be anything it could be. Be like me. For example, I've broken my arm twice in the same place. It was my left radius and it was within the two-year span and you know that second time that I broke it. I definitely knew that it was broken unfortunately, but I'm here now, you know, I'm still thriving I'm still with my left hand, but what's one thing that you would like the audience to know about you one interesting thing. I'm trying to think about a really good fun fact here. Something that not a lot of people I guess would really know. I mean if I if I could bring it up back to you. You said you broke your arm should for three times twice twice twice. Okay, still shit ton of times. Um, I've I've broken every finger in my right hand because I was a center when I played football for Oak in my nose three times. Let's see. I've broken my back trying to PR on cleaning power cleaning for those who don't know that there's Olympic lifts. But yeah, I'm sure there's another interesting fact, that's a escaping me now because I'm in I'm in front of Gilbert right now. And so I just had to bring it back and you know compared to compared the scars. I guess, you know sounds good with me. All righty, ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna get into this review really quick. And first I'm going to list down some positives. I Add with Back to the Future. So for those of you that don't know Back to the Future is directed by Robert zemeckis. He did direct Forrest Gump as well and welcome to Morrow and I believe and it stars Michael J Fox as Marty McFly and the way that it goes is Marty McFly's just the guy in high school just like we all were at some point and he's best friends with Doc Brown and one day Doc Brown creates this beautiful invention. That's taken up most of his. Life and his life savings and it's it's a time machine. It's a time machine where if you wanted to go back to the Great Depression, I mean, I don't know why you would but just saying if you wanted to you could definitely go back to that and witness that stock market crash or if you wanted to see Neil Armstrong land on the moon. You could definitely do that to two opposite ends. And it's it's in a DeLorean to it's not just in a refrigerator or whatever. It's in it's with style. It's The DeLorean and together him in Doc embark on this journey where he does go back in time. But like time goes you gotta go back to your set reality otherwise consequences start to happen and it's just all about the Race Against Time while also visiting familiar faces on Long the way. So this movie came out about 30 34 years ago. I might be mistaken maybe more But to be honest, I barely saw this film for the first time. I believe it was junior year of high school and it was in my physics class. I remember thinking okay, like I've heard a lot about Back to the Future, but I've never really delved into it. Like what's the hype about so thank you to George piroshki by the way for for showing us this great movie because to be honest that viewing was amazing. I think the story is very Very creative but also has a lot of heart and it's very funny. I love the chemistry between Doc Brown and Marty McFly. They have this kind of father-son relationship or kind of like that. Cool Uncle like you have at the family Barbecue and the way that doc has all these inventions you could already tell just from the first five minutes alone that this man may be a lunatic but let me tell you he is the smartest being and Seen Marty McFly go through this journey. And yeah, we're going to talk some spoilers here because like I said, this movie has been out for about 30 something years these throwbackthursday segments are going to be a little bit more spoiler filled because these are older movies that people should have seen by now, but if you don't want any spoilers, I'd say skip ahead to about maybe a couple minutes from now, but Marty McFly has to travel back to the present because otherwise his family in the present will be vanished. And the reason why that will happen is because when he does go back in time, he meets his dad he admits he meets his mom, but then his mom starts having the feels for him. It just gets kind of messy. There's no I mean nothing bad happens thankfully, but that provides most of the comedy there and just seeing how I mean think about it. How how would you react to seeing your parents back in? The 80s or the the 50s or you know, whenever they were born. It's insane and you wonder how that connection would be. Obviously you can't tell them or else they'll have a funny feeling and that affects not only your future but their future so seeing that Dynamic was great. And also I really like the set pieces in here. It's very simplistic Steven Spielberg did no no. No, I'm sorry. Robert zemeckis did use part of Steven Spielberg. six sets from a universal so that little town area that you see in the beginning that's from Gremlins and definitely other Spielberg films, but it's all some kind of revisiting this movie too because of the historical impact its had, you know, 1.2 gigawatts and 88 miles per hour and it's amazing in every sort of way possible why it's definitely my favorite 80s movie of all time and that's a statement because the 80s Not only had the best music in my opinion, but they also had some of the best movies in that era. Now. Those are just my quick thoughts, but I'm going to turn it over to Tristan really quick and he's just gonna talk about you know, what are some things that he likes and also maybe if it's had an impact has definitely movies out there that have had an impact on people for example, this channel is directly inspired by this film. So I'm going to turn it over to uterus to know what do you like more about this? Movie and if you have any negatives to towards the end, you know, I'd love to hear those as well. So I guess I should start with the first time. I saw a Back to the Future. Um, I it's I it's funny I distinctly remember the first time I washed it but I don't remember the details the movie. So I was in my friends mom's minivan. We were going out to eat. Not to dinner out Newport and we live in Mission Viejo. So they was the the Mini Van de that OG minivan with the the movie screens on the back and they were playing Back to the Future and you know, obviously they've been watching it for a while because I just jumped right in the middle of and I'm like what the hell is going on here. I must have been maybe 9 10 maybe 11 years old and I was watching and I was just kind of drawn in by by the acting and I wouldn't really like culminate in terms of my any of the movie in my my thoughts on it until much much later when I re-watched it at age 16, I believe and then again like it's like, you know every year. I just I guess I just kind of end up watching it and then I've seen it just last week. So it's really fresh in my fresh in my mind. If I got to say one thing to kind of like kind of build from like a smaller standpoint to like a bigger standpoint. You know you brought up the town. I was like used Steven Spielberg's used to use it a few times. I got to say, you know, the town is probably one of the best parts of that movie. It just it's it's own little world, you know, like aside from the the scene where Marty first uses the DeLorean the time machine and crashes through that that barn house and it's got the the alien all the alien shit on and and you know that dude shoots at him with a shotgun which by the way like if you look at where the Like that Marty should be dead. That's the little that was a little little nitpicky point. I'm like, oh, you know what he was right behind that. There's no fucking way. Um, so but outside of that little seen the town it like it had its own little life, even in the beginning when Marty was was skating by on the back of that truck. He's waving hide all these people in that Fitness class. He's going by the diner the the park the clock tower, of course and then like, you know right across from all those things. The school and like all these events that happen movie take place in this like in maybe like a two-mile radius like outside of again the barn scene so that town really is like a it kind of came alive like you were like, oh man, this is real the 80s. Oh man. This is really the 50s kind of thing. So that was really stand out aspect to me to me another really good aspect if you just start small as the acting come on like the the acting was so So outrageous and over the top and it was so very clearly like a movie, you know, and sometimes it's a bad thing. But in this case it was a it was a good thing. You know, you're like, okay, this is this is just something fun to watch like this is something fun to watch course Doc is like you said Gilbert. He's he's crazy while I was out there, but you can tell he's real smart kind of thing Marty's this this over the top, you know high school kid, who's who you don't really can't can't really tell if he's cool. If he's the you know, the stereotypical the cool kid ya the cool kid or the or the kind of like laid-back dude, or you know, you never really know because he's you don't really learn so much about how where he liked how we got to meet Doc and all this kind of stuff. So Marty's girlfriend who just doesn't really doesn't release is really do too much until they and the beginning and the very end and and then of course Marty's dad played by Crispin Glover who was who was hilarious the entire way through the the when he's eating peanut brittle watching these his little his laugh. His laugh is like man, it's Poindexter all the way. This dude is a fucking nerd like there's no there's no way like, how did he conceived this child? You know Marty's Mom Lorraine. She was obviously a pivotal character in the in the series. Um, not a series. Well, yeah in the series bend the the first movie, you know what that opening scene where he first meets his mom in the future not gonna lie. Oh, yeah Lea Thompson Lea Thompson played the rain. So but that opening scene Gilbert when when he woke up in the bed, and he thought he thought, you know, he was back and just had a crazy dream Calvin Calvin Calvin Klein. Oh my Oh God, you know it's funny. I didn't even get that fucking joke until like oh, it's underwear. I'm so fucking stupid people, you know, like people people put it on their underwear back then I don't why why I don't know. Why did they get lost often back then? 1985? Yes. I do not have a pair of Calvin's expensive. Yeah, they're pretty expensive. Honestly, just threw them we'll do it. Anyway anyway, Marty's Marty's mom. I remember first watching that when I was younger and like the way she behavior on Marty that like dude that that that sort of like next-level thirst kind of thing and I was watching that on his kid. I'm like, there's no fucking way girls act like this this cannot be fucking real that scene really like it set the tone and of course all the events that followed and you know, we're going to get into it, you know a little bit more. But this is just the the characters in the sets that really it just you know, it took the film to the next level as they shouldn't have film like that but just because how outrageous they were and how well the the actors performed I think was probably the best interest, you know, it's what keeps me coming back to watch it. So definitely the best thing there. Do you have any negatives with the film or is this just a film where no matter what time of day? You put it on you're attached to that couch, no matter what and you're watching it just from start to finish. How do you feel I feel like that again. The film is timeless and I've been I'm so I'm I know a lot of people are they say, they're into movies and Gilbert you're very clearly in the movies. But I'm I'm also very very into movies to the point where like the soundtrack was like, you know, pop out to me if it's real good arrival, which is one of my all-time favorite movies the soundtrack there was Was Unreal to me, but anyway the point being of so with that movie background. I kind of like I dug deep a little bit into it and there was a couple couple things. I was just kind of wondering like okay. I know they're not going to address it in the movie, but I'm gonna dress it in my in my head. I'm going to figure out why this is happening. So you remember a lot of things change when Marty gets back. From the past and goes back to the future and he he comes back in his life is infinitely improved, right? All right, you know but there's the scene when he comes back and he schedules right before he schedules right before he comes back. He's like, you know what I want to go back in time to warn because in the movie Doc refuses to know anything about the future so he goes back as I got my said it before so we pops up, you know in in that timeframe right before doc is killed. So Doc is killed in the beginning of the film spoiler. Sorry, I should have said that he's Kiya Hai if you haven't seen it, you know shits on you, but So in the very beginning he watches dot get blown away and then he watches himself almost get blown away and then a little I guess chase scene ensues how you know, he hops in the DeLorean and takes off and then he's he's back in the past again. So here's my question. How long has that been going on has this has the whole Back to the Future movie you take it as like an exclusive thing is Marty's life. Just one Eternal Loop is just always going to be a Marty because we're breaching some some existential shit right here. We're getting real deep into this Gilbert. We're gonna we're gonna figure out what makes this movie tick. I know they weren't going to answer in a little comedy. But Marty I mean is it is that just destined to happen forever? And also if Marty made it back to save Doc how come doc isn't with the prior knowledge or is this the first time this happened? You know, I got a lot of questions. I got a lot of questions and that's kind of one thing that stuck out with me. Because it's you know, it's just a feel-good movie and no one's in there. Like okay, but think about this what if it was a separate reality and it no one's in the movie theater, like think about this. They're just enjoying themselves, but I'm fucking thinking about it. So I'm coming here to tell you what the hell just happened. Well, you know you bring up a great Point actually and it kind of revert back to end game in a sense. I'll go where yeah, but that's a discussion for another day. Absolutely, but I can definitely see that but also I think this is one of those movies where you do have to use your imagination and I'm going to draw inspiration from 2009's Inception. Okay, so spoilers below for Inception if you haven't seen it, but again if I mean, what are you doing man director directed by Christopher Nolan? So Leonardo DiCaprio is a dream stealer, and I'm just going to go into this pretty quickly and he has to do a mission in order to see his family again. So at the very end after all this stuff goes down. They have this little object that the thief essentially has to distinguish. What's real and what's a dream Leonardo DiCaprio spins it while he sees his kids at the very end and that last shot is the totem and it's still spinning and then it just cuts so you're stuck wondering. Oh, is that a dream? Is it reality? So I I like to personally just use my imagination. I saw it kind of twist a little bit and I'd like to assume it is a dream and this is a little different though because it was confirmed later by Michael Keaton that ended up being reality, but I do understand that concern though because yeah, you do wonder you know McFly does see himself go back to the past essentially again. So you're stuck wondering is this just going to be a timely well, maybe not right? Or maybe it could go into a different time parallel. I mean time is inevitable and it's it's almost Infinity now to wrap this up. We're going to go with the rating and honestly, I'm going to give it a 9 out of 10. I I like Tristan said it's literally a Timeless classic my all-time favorite 80s movie confirmed, especially after seeing it last month at a screening at Park. I think it's one of the most iconic films. Yes, and yeah, you got honestly could never go wrong with Back to the Future. I mean, maybe the other two aren't as good they're still solid but not as good as the first however don't let distinguish the fact that this first one is an absolute Gem and you know real quick Tristan before we depart of what would you give this movie? Um, I'd have to give it I'd you know, your nine was good. I'd have to give it an 8 out of 10. The only reason I gave I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 is you know, I really like the are pretty much everything in this movie was I can't say it's perfect because that's completely subjective. But from my point of view is a everything was on point. No one seemed even though the acting is outrageous. No one seem fake don't seem fake now the set seemed fake either. They didn't seem like they were something that was like just kind of conceived in the backstage. Again, the only thing that I'd have to say based on that is not anything that's do with the movie itself in terms of like the making but like some of the concepts in it, you know, they get they'll get a little muddled in there. Like honestly the whole butterfly flat but it Butterfly Effect like how much does he does? Does he really change and how come how come everything that he's changed? His only given him a like a good outcome like, you know, I know it's just like feel-good movie. I understand that completely. So these are Obviously very nitpicky, but other than that fantastic movie if you haven't seen it, I recommend going to see it tonight if you could and I definitely agree remember guys, you guys have your own opinion my good friend Tristan here just because he says some negatives or nitpicks that doesn't distinguish the fact that I like the movie. You just got to have an open mind that other people for other people some things just might not fit well and guys, this is just Like a little bit of advice to for not only this podcast but you know take take my opinions with the grain of salt too. So just because let's say I like a movie maybe you might not just because I didn't like the movie doesn't mean you may not that's why I try not to look at Rotten Tomatoes or any sort of critic scores prior to seen any movies because I do want to develop my own opinion as an honest truth to you guys. Otherwise this defeats the purpose of speaking my mind and being my own. Critic, but yeah, we're going to wrap this up sewed up. I just want to thank Tristan again for coming on board with me and you know, thank you for making time today. Thank you. Absolutely. This was this is awesome. I hope to be on the show again and his great time. Oh, you will be we do have some recommendations that we do want to get into later. Yes. Yes, but no no, no, I can't sing. Okay. All right.

We hope you enjoyed this episode of The Hog talk.Yo, what's going on? Everybody? Welcome to episode 30 freaking one of the hardtalk podcast Jacob and I were just talking before we went live before we started recording that is flown by and it's been a lot of fun Jacob sir. How you doing? Man? Doing great. How about you man? You know, not that great considering my Cardinals laid an egg against the against Washington little embarrassing.Good wasn't good. But hey, at least y'all made it in your competed. I didn't I did not have them in fact, you know something else we're talking about before we started recording. I told you that you know, the MLB app At Bat app I had they did a postseason pick them like a tourney pick them right playoff bracket and I had the Cardinals getting swept by the Braves that that's what's funny about. This is like they turn around and then when they took on the Nats, I thought Washington's not that great. I mean, yeah, they're okay. They're I mean, they're decent enough to get to where they're at. And it shouldn't shock anybody that they're playing for the pennant but like the Cardinals the way how well they played against Atlanta for the most part still inconsistent at the plate. But for the most part, you know, they played pretty good ball and advanced. I thought they would get past Washington and I was so wrong that it's it hurts it got to the core of me it was Air hissing man. That was I don't know. It's one of those you here often like the way that you lose you would rather just not been in the situation begin with because of how you lost and that's exactly the kind of how I felt with the Cardinals. In that in that matchup against the Nats to play for the pain and it was just embarrassing but it is what it is. Hopefully they make some moves in the offseason get some hitters get a little bit. I don't know what they got to do about hitting they're hitting the season was so wildly inconsistent, but it is what it is. So like I said episode 31, it's been fun. It's been an absolute blast Jacob. I wanted to give everybody a real quick update. On the pig trail Network. Yeah, go ahead. We had we had kind of briefly mentioned this before about maybe renaming the pig trail and maybe they're going to be some changes coming. What what I'm going to do with the picture. OWN Network YouTube channel. It's going to stay there. I'm still here at the hog Talk podcast. Nothing with me is changing. If anything you're just getting more more of me stretched out so thin and not getting paid a dime for it, but I'm here. And I love doing it. I love talking with you guys. I love the hog talk and interacting with fans on the live streams on the YouTube channel. So I thought you know what I've had I've had enough people tell me that they really wish that I would format those live streams into podcasts form. And that's what I'm going to do. So I will have I will have the live shows starting this upcoming Monday. I don't have the calendar in front of me. Whatever what the Monday following Halloween. How about that? We'll have that show and from then on every live show that we do other than the post-game shows the post-game shows will not be turned into podcast. But the Monday and Friday shows will be turned into podcast. You'll be able to listen to them on iTunes and wherever I can wherever I can get it to I'll keep you guys up to date there, but I want to thank everybody for following me everywhere. I've gone whether it was with the pig trailer coming over to the hog Talk podcast. There's some people who still follow me back when I used to stream on Twitch. Part of the digital fire podcast. So I really do appreciate every single one of you so that's what's going to change I guess or what's going to be added to the to the roster of things tie Hudson is doing so I've got a I've got a pretty loaded down plate, but I'm really excited about doing it and there's still a conversation to be had about whether or not I'm going to do a middle of the week show for the for the for the podcast but it will be called the pig trail podcast. That's where you can find it and that should be up and ready for you guys to go. Oh that following Tuesday after the live stream. So let's move on Arkansas hosting Auburn. Oh my we're coming off a disappointing loss against Kentucky for the Razorbacks. We can all talk about a hundred year check once too kind of brag a little bit about how all their last three losses have been decided by a touchdown or less. It's funny that he knew he completely neglected to mention the fact that one of those losses came to a damn near an FCS program in San Jose State, but are Saul's going to host Auburn there Jacob. They're not too bad Gus. Malzahn is Auburn Tigers. They're actually they're okay, even though they're coming off a close loss to Florida. What are your thoughts here with this game going in? What is this? A must must compete kind of game or is it and it doesn't really matter because they're ranked and everyone expects you to lose kind of game. Like, what's your how are you gauging this upcoming match up what the meaning of it? So the last year the game was pretty close until about the fourth quarter in Arkansas surrendered to special teens scores. I don't know if the game will be closed. The good thing is it's played at home. But how many fans are going to be there? It's a big big weekend with visitors and stuff and I think it's a crucial game top. I think it's crucial that that Arkansas place close and at least keeps them keeps it within maybe 14 It's I had I mean Arkansas has it been blown out in the game this year except the Ole Miss game where it was like a 31-17 lost. I was only about 14 points. So I mean you can say the Improvement being made but you can also see that certain players and may regressions. So I'm not going to say Arkansas is gonna compete but I'm not going to say they're going to lose by Twenty One or Twenty Eight at all, either even though I picked up the last week to win. I'm not pick them too. With another game this season that gonna cause I'm tired of hearing the proved wrong. So I think you know with it being a big weekend and Auburn's starting running back being out I think Arkansas if they can stop the run and force bow Nixon to some mistakes Arkansas can compete in this game. What's interesting is, you know, Auburn they beat Oregon to start the year off number and at the time I forgot where they're ranked. I think they're they're ranked still in the top 20, but They beat Oregon. It wasn't a convincing win or a you know, a blowout, you know, they won that won 27 to 21 and then they went on to continue a five game win streak until they lost against Florida on the road 24 213. I said that was close maybe to them that's not close. I'm sure to Auburn fans that might as well just been a blowout but you know losing by 11 points to Florida, but you got to consider, you know Flores pretty good. Although I'm going to admit I completely thought Florida where I thought they were Pretenders happy they're going to get Throttled last weekend LSU and they see they stood ground man. They stood ground. Yeah Florida's Florida's look pretty good. So the line is it is right. Now, of course the ESPN football power index has Auburn to No Surprise overwhelmingly favored at 93.4% Arkansas 16.6. Yeah the line what's interesting to me is the spread is at 19 and a half and I don't know like this to me is one where I don't I don't know. I don't think aubert is is that fantastic on offense? I just I know that they're definitely way ahead of Arkansas. Like you said Arkansas has not been blown out by anybody and I think you could you could chalk up a you know, I guess you could chalk up a 19-point game as being a blowout or 21-point. Yeah, that's definitely a blowout but I don't know that that happens here. But the line or the money line is that plus 900. I don't know what the hell that means. I'm just going to say it because it's here in front of me on the screen. I don't know what that means the money line, but the over unders it fifty five and a half again the spread is 19 and a half obviously in favor for the for Auburn. I asked it every week. Do you think Arkansas covers? Yes, I think they cover long pause. Well, it's a 19-point 19. So I mean they better I mean if they don't lose a game by 14 points or more. Yeah, I mean 19 I think manageable if they can if they can I mean the plus side is it's at home. So you're in you're in friendly confines whether or not Arkansas fans will you know show up? I mean, you just don't know. So I think they've happened a my cover. I think I'm going to be real. I think this is the first time all year since I've been asking the question. I think I'm gonna take Arkansas to cover. Yeah, I don't you know, we talked about it whitlow's out there starting running back. This guy is averaging, you know, he's averaging what 5 plus yards a carry. He's looked okay in conference play 544 yards. I think he's seven. I think it's seven total touchdowns on the year. I'm not sure if he has any receiving touchdowns or not be at 7 at least rushing. They don't really We stretch the field, you know, they've got Williams their leading receiver 21 catches three hundred eight yards. He does have five touchdowns, which is nice. I think for the most part Arkansas is pretty healthy. It's at home. I do think fans show up. I don't know how many I I mean what I guess what I'm getting at is I think that more fans will show up than first expected. I really thought that's all would probably I said talking to my dad. I said, maybe 40,000 I'm Might actually find a way to get 55 55 60 thousand people in Fayetteville. Look if you get it just a little bit of electricity going to that place. It can be real markets loud. It gets loud there and we've had two former Alabama quarterback say that that is the most hostile territory they've ever played in and I think that if you get enough people there if it's loud enough, I think they cover because of that. I think that's the fan Factor, you know first SEC game in Fayetteville. Am I right about that? Is that first sec. See game in my car. Yeah, it is. Yeah, that's right. We only have two. Yeah, when you look at Auburn here's what here's what's crazy rushing yards allowed per game a hundred and one yards per game on the ground in this day and age that's that is unbelievable. Everybody gives up like 140 like everybody even the decent or the great s easier a really good SEC defense has or given up, you know. More than that, I think they've got to be it's got to be the best run defense in the SEC their defensive line. There's no doubt about their defensive line is arguably one of the best and not just the SEC West or just the SEC but maybe even in the country these guys give up 18 points a game to Arkansas is 27. They still manage despite their offense having some some on-and-off-again some inconsistency there according to Auburn fans that I've talked to they're still get they're still getting about four hundred twenty yards a game 193 through the air and and obviously they're doing everything on the ground with Whitlow and Company but he's not going to be there. So you wonder if they could contain Nick's I don't know. I think you and I both are pretty skeptical there. What is with Whitlow out. What do you expect this defense to maybe make a jump of the right direction this week. I know everyone's rolling their eyes hearing that but you think there's an opportunity here to maybe two at least at least make some effort where we didn't see against Kentucky this week. You can file born in front of a home crowd I think there Could be I mean you get a couple of stops early on in the Ballgame when cam Martin and running back and I think Arkansas, I mean if you start off the game, okay with a couple stops. Yeah, I think I think they might smell blood early. I think they'll be hey we can hang with these guys. Yeah, I think so. When you when you look at where our bird is as far as numbers on offense, look they're passing offense is near the bottom of college football. It's like a hundred and I think a hundred and fifty hundred and tenth something like that and passing, you know, they only averaged right around 33 points a game the there's no doubt this team if you wanted to say they had Kryptonite it would be the inconsistencies. They've they've had on offense their defense is their strength without a doubt 18 points. Game is absolutely incredible and I'm gonna always mention this day and age because I've I have a I just have a belief that the game of football so geared heavily and favorably towards offensive, you know swords off its a foot. Yeah, and it's probably more so ever than all of the history of football whether it's college or Pros. It's just it's rigged for offenses to succeed if you want my opinion. So if if you're only giving up 18 points and Game, that's incredible. Even in this conference where you know, I do think the SE c--'s take a little bit of a step back over the years. They're not what they were five six seven years ago, but it's still a tough conference. And so to have a defense. This is good as there is it's especially when you consider who they've already played, you know, they've played a ranked Oregon team that played a ranked am team and they've played a ranked Florida team and they're still giving up really good or they have great numbers on defense. So yeah. This is the question that I think we it's another one of those that we asked week in and week out. What are they going to do a quarterback this weekend against these guys? Are we going to see more Switcheroo or we going to see someone step up and be consistent and maybe keep the job through four quarters or do you think it's going to be another it just another week two-headed quarterback situation. Look you have to stick with a quarterback and role within because this week six you're about to this it and Texas A&M and and Kentucky anymore. You're moving into Alabama LSU Auburn this weekend, Mississippi State. A Missouri. These are the guys that you have left on the schedule. You better find a guy and stick with them no more musical chairs at quarterback. I mean, I know NYX dark will hasn't played as great as he I mean he had been playing. I mean there's good as he had been playing but look he still completing 60 percent of his passes. I mean, he's not been terrible, but I don't think he's been a Super upgrade over been Hicks who's come in and played admirably in In relief Stark of the past couple of weeks, you know, what's interesting that we've seen every week when they've had a swap at quarterback. The guy that guy second half the quarterback that comes in to finish the game looks better. Yeah, is that not strange like and it doesn't seem to matter who it is whether it's starkel coming in for Hicks or vice versa. There's a real there's a real belief that now they're going to have to do something with John Stephen Jones and KJ and you wonder if we see more of this More the inconsistencies the mistakes made by starkel and Ben hates not being able to stretch the field and really limiting the offense if they shouldn't just go ahead and throw KJ and that's all local radios been talking about that's about all anyone talks about anywhere whether it's in my live streams on YouTube or on Twitter or Facebook. I really think it reminds me so much of the Mitch mustain during the Casey dick years when our year sorry not plural because obviously Mitch's only here for Year, remember the pressure that was put on Houston that to bring in to bring in Mitch Mustang. Oh, absolutely. I was at USC game when when we turn the ball over like 15 times and obviously they beat the crap out of Arkansas in Fayetteville and went on and did great things and Arkansas turn around and found a way to win 10 games, but I can remember the crowd chanting for Mitch to come in and I think it started like in the third core of the second or third quarter and eventually they did they put Mitch in and you kind of Wonder if that's not where we're headed with KJ. I don't know in that was going to be my question. I can't remember if I've asked you this before do you think it would is it smart or when you talk about putting KJ in what does that what does it do for him? Does it get him prepared getting him in live-action it gets an SEC opponent or does it may be hurt his chances moving forward because at this point if you play him this week, you don't burn his Redshirt. He's got four games. So maybe it's a smart thing to do. What is your opinion on bringing KJ and Jacob? I don't think it would be a bad thing at all. I mean Casey dick him. He came in and played as a true freshman as well. Oh and Casey was I mean no offense to him, but he wasn't nearly the quarterback that came out of high school is what K Jefferson was and yeah, this is a different time. You know, this is 14 years later can exudate came in completed 53 passes for 99 or out of 99 was 53 percent completion percentage had seven touchdowns of for Pics, that's the I think if you're going to bring KJ % into play quarterback at any point in this year as a starter you play in the last four games that way you can store Redshirt him. Yeah and plus your you only have I think LSU you have LSU Western, Kentucky, Missouri and Mississippi State those last four games. That's not bad. It's not that bad schedule to you know, put into the fire. I mean those are those are three winnable games if you can still consider, Arkansas, A 4/5 when team and you play him at LSU, obviously, that would be where his career starts at for Arkansas. I mean, it didn't hurt too bad last time Arkansas put out a freshman quarterback. The last four games of the season is running out Brandon Allen against Alabama. Yeah, but but the thing was Tyler Wilson ended up coming back and finishing finishing out his career he did but I guess the point I'm making is that they did still there. The men they put him in, you know through his feet to the fire and and it didn't it didn't hurt his career. And I think I'm one of those who believe that Brandon Allen was a pretty damn good quarterback in Arkansas. I know he was leading up to his senior year. His numbers were very not monitoring their modest their modest and then his senior year he goes off but yet for whatever reason he's still one of the most, you know, you mentioned the last name Alan and people are like that was the biggest mistake to ever happen at Arkansas and it's like well actually if you look back, He's probably one of the better quarterbacks right or his senior season was phenomenal. So you wonder if maybe he got a learning experience out of that. Maybe that benefited Brandon to go in against Alabama. I guess it's kind of my point with KJ maybe putting them in against Auburn. Yeah, I'm with you. I think you put them in against against Mississippi State on November 2nd, you know, you've got Mississippi State in Fayetteville just set up perfect. Then you've got Western Kentucky at home. Again that's on the 9th and then you've got on the road against LSU and You're down in Little Rock for the Mizzou game. So you get three chances at home in front of a non-hostile crowd. Well, you know until you're getting blown out then the crowd might kind of turn on you a little bit but you have an opportunity to he's gonna miss you. I don't know if it'd been at the thing is is I guess it depends on where you're at in the year to if if you're still fighting and they will because they have two wins. You're still trying to fight you believe Chad Morris doesn't buy into the fan rhetoric. Okay, that would be the dumbest thing on earth. To do these players are bought in and believing that week in and week out there still competing to make a bowl game. That's like I don't see them doing that with can I don't I I kind of hope that that we at least see some of KJ I hope we get to see him in four games this year. So he doesn't burn his Redshirt. So we get an opportunity to see maybe just where he's at as a true freshman. I don't I don't see them starting KJ though because at that point you're still fighting for an opportunity to go to a bowl game. And even though I think you and I are on the same page. I feel like they go. 3:9 to finish the year off, but I don't know what starting KJ does for you other than get him on the field experience against you know quality opponent. But yeah Auburn this Saturday 11 a.m. Kick off in Fayetteville. Auburn is all of you most of you know there to 1 in conference, they're five and one technically third in the SEC West somewhere you obviously if you're doing a power pole, you've probably got most people have Auburn in the top five behind. Bama and LSU believe it or not. You should I mean other than Florida over in the East you've got Mizzou sitting at two and oh in conference play five and one overall record, which really if you look at their their schedule that shouldn't shouldn't I be shocked you? Yeah, they're share their schedules an absolute joke. I mean their upcoming mizzou's upcoming match up at Vanderbilt at Kentucky, but then they got to play Georgia and Florida, but then after that, it's Tennessee and Arkansas, they've got they've got 9 and 3/8 and for kind of written on them, but that's going to be Last opponent to close the year out. So I guess I don't know if we're forgetting anything Jacob I guess speak now or forever hold your peace, or at least until the next podcast. We have anything else we want to talk about or is that going to wrap it up? You think how I think that'll do it? Okay, you did want to mention earlier before the show about what Hunter you're a chick said today. Yeah, you brought that up about but he said it's quote about the three wins 3 losses. Did I can't remember if we recorded that part or not. Now, we didn't know he put out a on his what do you call it the from the desk of your ad is the name of this little column that he does for our kids are Razorbacks.com. And in there he mentioned, you know, he kind of brings he's it's obviously about football and what's our excuse me basketball rather, but in there he mentions that you know, Arkansas how nobody's really excited about the three losses. I'm trying to find it verbatim but I can't find it the what he had said, but he had mentioned the three losses and how they were decided by seven points or less and it's like why I get as an ADD and you're trying to address the fans. You can't come off to negative because then it's like you're not buying into Going on with Chad Morris and it's obviously. You know, I guess I guess what I'm saying is he actually probably did exactly what he should do. Here. It is. I found it. He says in this article says clearly our win-loss record at this point in the season is not where anyone would like it to be a loss is a loss but I am encouraged. I am encouraged. He says that in each of the of our last three games all decided by one score less at the Arkansas or that the Razorbacks had chance in the later stages of each to earn a win. I can assure you that no one is more disappointed. I need that. We were unable to do that than the young men and the coaching staff who have to put in countless hours in preparation for the season. I that's not what fans are upset about if anything if you change who one of those losses, you know, maybe turn that into an SEC opponent and I'm talking about San Jose State then that's a different conversation. Like yeah, we all we agreed Hunter but the the conversation has to be had at some point that you just lost. Us to an embarrassing a damn near FCS program in San Jose State. That's who one of those three losses are two in front of your home crowd. That's there's no even at a neutral site or on the road. There's no excuse for that losing to someone like that. Now, I know we can't I don't want to beat our fans over the head with that because we've kind of bitched and moaned about that a lot here about that San Jose State lost but for I think 400 a kind of put that out in neglect to put in something about San Jose State, that's the problem that people have Yeah, it's the fact that you lost to San Jose State period that's what people are concerned about and I wanted to point that out really quick. I did tweet it. I'll put it out on the Twitter. It's not getting a whole lot of traction, but I wanted to mention it here. I don't know. I don't know what the right thing for him to do. There is if he should have mentioned San Jose State maybe I think you probably should have to some extent like yeah, we lost his hand has a state that's a gut check but you know, maybe you could put in I have We could turn this thing around, you know, the typical kind of AD speech but I don't know. I kind of felt like he shot. He should have included San Jose State. That's the thing that we have the the most concern with not the other losses. It's the San Jose State Los, right? Yeah this definitely disheartening but I don't have anything to add to that because you already know how I feel. Yeah, we've beat our fan and really the point wasn't to continue griping about the San Jose State lost. It was the fact that you know, I I like it. I She ate the hunter brought up football, you know, and I guess some of already made the argument on Twitter that he didn't have to although I kind of feel like he does. I kind of feel like he's been mostly a little too quiet can all things considered this happen and but for him to at least, you know, give a little hint to the you know to what's going on with football. I guess I guess we'll take it. You know, it is what it is. So, all right well for episode 31 here in the hawk podcast. Thank you guys so much for tuning in as always download these episodes.

You can schedule a free 20 minute consult with me through tiny feet and the link to Your consult is also in the episode description. All right, guys, let's get started on today's episode. We are going to start by talking about one of our favorite nutrition resources for both preconception and pregnancy. The book is called real food for pregnancy. It's by Lily Nichols. She is a registered dietician who is known for being very evidence-based. So this book is a research supported guide. It has over 900 scientific study references that are all about sharing the most up-to-date. Eight research on nutrition for pregnancy and this information is also applicable to preconception. So some of the things that you'll learn from Lily's book is why conventional nutrition advice for pregnancy is pretty outdated and really not based on the best available evidence that we have right now why it's important to focus on real food for the health of your pregnancy and how this can specifically impact long-term health and development for your baby what it actually means to eat real food. And which foods are the most important. And to include in your diet during pregnancy and then of course if we're going to talk about what to eat she has to talk about what foods are best limited or left out of the diet during pregnancy. And then Lily also shares a ton of recipes to help get you started on this real food eating journey, and in addition to nutrition, she also shares some evidence-based advice on supplements lab test that you might want to seek out during pregnancy environmental toxins to avoid and then postpartum recovery after baby comes so we do love recommending this book to pregnant moms. But if you're in that preconception period this is also going to be a great book for you the same foods and habits that support a healthy pregnancy also support your fertility. So if you're thinking of starting a family anytime within the next few years, you're wanting to know what you can do to proactively prepare with nutrition. This is an awesome book for you to read if you would like to learn a little bit more about the book and here from Lily personally. We do have a podcast interview with her. That's episode 15. Podcast and we are actually hoping to have her back on again this year to share a little bit more with you guys. So on to our next recommendation, which is beyond the Pill by dr. Jolene brighten, and dr. Haley is going to cover that one for us. Yep. Thanks Kristen. So the next section of books that we're going to be talking about is on the menstrual cycle and hormone balance. And the first book that we want to mention is beyond the Pill by dr. Joley Brighton. She's a naturopathic doctor here in Portland, Oregon. And be on the pill is a fantastic Women's Health Resource that really investigates the risks associated with hormonal contraceptives and provides women with a blueprint to recover optimal hormonal Health after coming off birth control. It can also help women who are still taking birth control mitigate some of the potential side effects and this book is going to help you understand more specifically the risks and side effects of the pill that are often not shared with women when they first begin the birth control pill. Including effects on gut health immune function thyroid hormone Liver Health and fertility. Also what post birth control syndrome is so that's post birth control syndrome. This is something that is relatively new that not a lot a lot of doctors know about she kind of coined the term and she goes into more detail on that and how it can affect women in different ways as they're coming off of the pill. And then also how specific hormonal imbalances kind of manifest in your body and how to identify whether you have any of these imbalances. So I like how she put this book together in different quizzes. And so you can really break down what type of imbalances you have whether it's like high testosterone or low progesterone and then she'll give you detailed advice on dietary changes testing that you can have done at your doctor and specific supplementation. Will help you regain your health and hormone balance based off of pretty much the answers to those quizzes. So this book is amazing for anyone who has experienced negative side effects to taking the birth control pill or after you've stopped. It's also a great resource for women who originally prescribed the pill for any other reason other than preventing pregnancy which happens a lot. So if you are prescribed the pill for take or having acne irregular or absent Cycles painful or heavy periods If you experience endometriosis PCOS and Other Home hormonal imbalances, so you'll learn about which hormones may be out of balance in the body and then what steps to take so as I explained a little bit earlier you kind of take a quiz and then she'll walk you down that rabbit hole in the book and where you want to go based off of those answers. So we highly recommend this book if you're for those who are planning to or have recently come off the birth control pill or wanting to conceive in the next year and to learn more we We did have an interview with dr. Joley in Brighton and discuss the book in detail in episode 23 of the podcast. So the next book that we would recommend for your helping menstrual cycle is the period repair manual and that's by dr. Laura Brighton and Kristen can talk more about that book. Yeah. So this is a great one. This is actually one of the first books. I think I read when I was really wanting to learn more about women's health and hormones. And so this is Lie about natural treatments to improve menstrual cycle health. So, dr. Brighton is kind of the the queen of period problem. She spends a lot of time talking about issues that affect the menstrual cycle on her blog on her Instagram and in her book, so she's going to go into information such as why birth control doesn't actually treat period problems. You'll also find some of that information and be on the pill but the context is a little bit different. Dr. Biden also goes over what a healthy menstrual cycle should really look and more importantly what it should feel like to each woman and then she goes into pretty amazing detail about how to use natural treatments like Diet lifestyle and specific supplementation to address common period issues. So that includes irregular or absent periods or PCOS endometriosis heavy or painful periods. Also PC and PMs and other mood imbalances breast pain and several other things in the book as well. So this is a great one to consider for pretty much all women who are of reproductive age to learn and read more about how our bodies are supposed to work. And what factors might be at play. If you are having problems with your cycle, and if you would like to learn more from dr. Brighton, we interviewed her in episode 24 and 47 of the podcast. So 24, I believe is all about PCOS and then 47 is about the connection between estrogen and histamine, so You'll learn different things in each of those episodes but they are both awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Dr. Biden's pretty amazing. I remember when we first interviewed her eye. She has a very motherly voice. It's very soft and nurturing and you just want to talk to her all day because you just feel like you know, she's giving you like a hug over over over the Internet. Yeah. She's pretty amazing to listen to and she's just so so smart. So we definitely recommend listening to those episodes. Yeah. The next book that we wanted to talk about in this particular category is the fifth Vital sign by Lisa Hendrickson Jack. She's really amazing. She just came out with this book last year and it's one of our absolute favorite books for learning about the inner workings of your body hormones and especially the menstrual cycle which she it's not. Well the association's say it's the fifth Vital sign, but that's what the book is called. The fifth Vital sign is a mentor. Recycle and it's perfect for learning how to track your cycle with the fertility awareness method So Lisa also used a lot of citations in this book over a thousand study citations. And so it's very heavy evidence-based book and it's one of the most well-researched women's health book out there for patients or clients or whoever wants to read it and we've mentioned this several times, but we do think that this book should be a required reading for every teenage girl getting her period it certainly can save a lot of women years of frustration and suffering through symptoms that were taught that are normal when they're not so in this book to be a little bit more specific you're going to learn why your menstrual cycle is such an important indicator of your health and what a normal cycle should look like she also takes a deep dive into your fertile signs particularly cervical mucus and how to track and chart them. Also how tracking your cycle can help you identify underlying issues with your health or fertility how birth control impacts your body and your cycle even after stopping after you stopped taking it and then also natural ways to support a healthy menstrual cycle and how you can intervene with diet and lifestyle changes to address recycle issues. So once again, this is an amazing resource for every Calling female. I recommend it pretty much to all my patients and out of I would say out of the three books that we just mentioned. This one would probably be my top favorite just because of the amount of citations and detail that she goes into and it's pretty easy to read especially if you don't really have any type of specific diagnosis and you're just kind of starting at a baseline. You just want to learn more about the cycle and then of course if you have like PCOS or enemy, Atrios osorno period at all. I mean, dr. Laura brightens book or even Jolene bright brightens book would be a great great resource. Also, we have interviewed Lisa twice on this podcast. So hopefully you've listened to her already, but if you haven't go check out episode 26, which is our first interview all about cervical mucus and then episode 55 is about tracking the menstrual cycle. And she does also have her own podcast, which is called fertility Friday and many of you may be familiar with that already, but she has been doing that for about five years and has a ton of great information on there as well. All right, so next up we're switching categories a little bit and this next book is the only one in its category which is all about genetics. And so the book is called Dirty Jeans by dr. Ben Lynch. He is a naturopathic doctor and has kind of dedicated his career to genetics nip a single nucleotide polymorphism research basically, these are little variations in genetic code that can have a pretty significant impact on health depending on which ones you have and in what combination so this is really about how these specific genetic variants can change the function of these genetic Pathways and can ultimately lead to some issues in the body and the book is really geared toward not just understanding what issues can arise but kind of specifically how to fix them and he calls that cleaning your jeans. So the book is dirty jeans and he talks all about how to clean your genes which I think is kind of cute. So there are seven genetic Snips that he goes into pretty awesome detail about and so some of those I'm sure that I'm not gonna remember all seven off the top of my head, but you're going to learn about things like MTHFR PE Mt. D. AO is in there comt of all these sound like Greek then you probably haven't done a genetic test for yourself yet. But if you have heard of these in you're looking to learn more, this is a great. To do that in and dr. Lynch is actually very passionate about improving Next Generation Health through preconception care. He owns a supplement company called seeking health and his prenatal vitamin that he formulated is actually one of our top recommendations to our clients and I really think of this book as a personalized preconception roadmap for women and couples if you use this book and kind of figure out what's going on with your body based on some of these genetic pathways, Ways you can really use the advice in here to personalize your pregnancy preparation by kind of diving into different areas of your health and investigating and adjusting Things based on the recommendations that he provides. So you'll learn things about diet lifestyle supplements and also advise for further investigation into your health based on some of these areas that he's going to talk about in the book. So we really recommend this to anyone that's interested at all in genetics and how genetic Snips might impact. Act reproductive and Childhood Health specifically, this will also be especially interesting to those of you that have had a genetic report run already such as through 23andMe or ancestry or our personal favorite, which is next-gen Labs. So we also have an interview with dr. Lynch on the podcast and we talked about his book as well as how genetics affect preconception Health pregnancy and Childhood Health and episode 35 of the podcast. So definitely check that one out if you're into Medics at all and I guess that brings us to our next category which is reducing the risk of miscarriage and investigating recurrent pregnancy loss and we have two amazing books to talk about in this category. Dr. Haley will talk about the first one which is called not broken up by dr. Laura Shaheen. Yeah, so, dr. Laura Shaheen is a reproductive endocrinologist from Seattle Washington and she recently wrote a book called not broken and this is based off of recurrent pregnancy loss and she talks about the medical definitions of miscarriage and also recurrent pregnancy loss. And then the statistics Behind these particular issues which are actually very reassuring I've used, you know repeated these statistics many times with my patients, which they've also found to be reassuring. So we appreciate her doing the research for us for that. And then she also talks about some possible issues that can cause recurrent pregnancy loss and then how to test for them and reducing sugar talks about reducing the risk of miscarriage through positive Lifestyle Changes, which is a common theme through a lot of these books. X and then also using integrative approach to fertility care with acupuncture and Eastern medicine. So this is a really good resource for couples who have been through more than or at least one miscarriage or more and wants an easy-to-understand guide about whether options are for testing and treatment from both a conventional standpoint and an integrated perspective and then the other book is called carrying to term by dr. Jordan. Robertson and she's a naturopathic doctor that practices in Canada. And this book is also all about reducing the risk of miscarriage which and what testing and treatments couples are can go ahead and seek out when they've had a miscarriage. She has a very interesting story because she as a student she's had she had multiple miscarriages herself. So that's why she's quite passionate about this topic and then she wrote this this book as a Source for her patience, and anybody who would like to read it we did interview. Dr. Robertson on the podcast so you can hear her story and her her inspiration for the book in episode 36 of the podcast, but she's also very evidence-based as well and she goes into some of the available research on things like thyroid testing and proactive Health assessments that you can do. And it could be really helpful. Just trying to simplify a very complicated process and helping you understand what test ask your doctor for and what certain terminology means such as like a luteal phase defect and PCOS and things like that. So it could be really helpful. I would say if you've experienced a miscarriage or more than one then these two books are come highly recommended. Yeah, I would if I had to differentiate I would probably say that I would recommend not broken to couples that have had at least two and if you're kind of sitting at one, I'd probably start with carrying to term because it's a little bit more about that proactive Health assessment kind of getting things checked out to see whether or not there might be a reason or just making sure that your health is kind of in Tip-Top shape. I also recommend carrying to term for couples that might be concerned about miscarriage for one reason or another because there are a lot of things in there that can help reduce your risk, even if you've never had a Loss so yeah, we did interview Dr. Shaheen on the podcast you recall what episode that was? Yeah, that was episode 32 yesterday's episode 32 with dr. Shaheen and it was episode 36 with dr. Robertson great. Perfect. So our next category is male fertility. And this is a this is another category. That only has one book in it because it is one of the very few do-it-yourself resources for men. A book is called fueling male fertility and it's by Lauren moniker and she is a registered dietitian. I'm with quite a lot of experience actually and she has recently opened a practice helping couples who are needing some help with nutrition around trying to conceive and you know, improving egg and sperm quality and I really love this book because I think it's good for men to have something that they can just do on their own that doesn't require them to go into a doctor or nutritionist and talk about the intimate details of their Sperm quality. I think that's something a lot of men kind of are very resistant to I mean, I know even as a nutritionist my husband doesn't even like to go to the doctor. So having to go to somebody else and talk about his swimmers might not be the most comfortable thing for him to do. So, I really like that. This is something that you know female Partners could listen to the podcast or read the book and be like here honey. Here's something you can do on your own or there's nobody kind of in-your-face asking you about these things. So that's one reason that I really like this and this is another evidence based resource. So this Is going to dive into why it's important for men to be focused on their fertility when I'm talking with clients. A lot of times. They're having trouble getting their partner on board. So this is a great explanation for why it's important for male Partners to be on board through this whole fertility process. It also goes over some really as obviously registered dietitian. She's going to be focused on diet what the best available evidence we have around diet and lifestyle factors that have been shown in the research to impact sperm quality and fertility success for couples and then how to go how to go about making some of these changes in diet lifestyle and then also supplementation. She goes into the evidence on supplements for things like antioxidants for instance to support a healthy conception. So this is great for couples who already know that they have male Factor infertility or for women who like I said want to gently nudge their Partners toward learning more without having to sit down and talk about this with the doctor or a nutritionist and we To interview Lauren on the podcast earlier this year. I guess I should say last year 2019 and that was episode 34. Yeah, so yeah, next category is bigger. It has three books in it. And this is all about infertility and going through fertility treatment. So dr. Haley kick us off with our first book. This is one of my favorite. It's starts with the egg with by dr. Are she's sorry not a doctor but researcher Rebecca Fett she's actually from the UK and she's written several books now since the first one came out and she has a Addition to it starts with the egg and just like the title says it's basically all about the science and research behind egg quality and how focusing on the health of your eggs can help you get pregnant naturally prevent miscarriage and increase your odds of success when you're going through IVF. So when you read this book, you're going to learn why a quality is really everything when it comes to fertility success, especially going through IVF. Owen toxic exposures and your environment that have been shown to affect fertility and how to avoid them. So one example is you really dive deep into BPA Plastics and will tell you why they're so harmful so you can better understand why it's so important to take the actions every day to avoid them also talks about possible contributing factors to fertility issues that your doctor may not have tested for yet. So maybe Spark Some thought around that and then also specific nutrients and supplements that support egg quality specifically and nutrition nutritional guidelines that can help support your fertility journey and then also recommendations for your partner to improve his sperm quality. So this is a really great place to start especially if you had it's been a while and you've been struggling to conceive or if you're working with an end a reproductive endocrinologist right now. We don't have unfortunately an interview with dr. With Rebecca Fett but we do have a really great episode Pretty popular episode on egg quality with dr. Jacqueline chassis. She's a naturopathic doctor that has been in the fertility specialized in particulate e for quite a long time so you can check that out and episode 27. All right. So next up in our fertility category is a book that is specifically. On nutrition for egg quality and IVF treatment. The book is called IVF meal plan and it is by our friend and colleague. Dr. Elizabeth Sheriff body. So this book focuses specifically on nutrition for egg and sperm quality leading up to and during IVF treatment. So it goes over everything that we know from research right now about how it diet affects egg quality and then takes you through 28 days worth of meal plans. So there's four seven Day meal plans in there and this is really going to help you out. Overhaul your nutrition to optimize your IVF success as much as you can. There are all kinds of Pearls of Wisdom and tips for Success that are peppered throughout the book and you're also going to receive some helpful advice on other things that impact fertility and IVF success such as avoiding hormone disrupting toxins. So this is definitely the perfect choice for women and couples who want to know how they should be fueling their bodies as they go through fertility treatment. These meal plans are also great for preconception nutrition. So even if you don't have Reason to expect that you might need to go through fertility treatment and you're really just looking for a well laid out easy-to-follow way to get started with preconception nutrition. This is a great resource for you. So we have interviewed. Dr. Liz twice on the podcast. The first time was in episode 8 and we talked to her about environmental toxin. She actually has a background in toxicology. So that's a great episode to listen to if you want to know about personal care products specifically that can have hormone disrupting toxins in them that are not good. For hormones and fertility and then most recently we talked to her in episode 53 of the podcast and we were interviewing her in preparation for IVF meal plan to come out so that episode is really focused on the book and how its intended to be used and she goes over some examples of what the nutrition and that book looks like. So if you are interested in this one episode 53 is a great one to listen to and that brings us to our final book in the infertility and fertility treatment category and that is called the Infertility Cure by dr. Randy Lewis. So dr. Haley tell us about that book. Yeah, this book provides an in-depth Eastern medicine perspective on infertility and how to restore reproductive Health naturally, so we don't have a lot of books or I guess any books on here that is Eastern medicine focused, but I think it's really important to have that perspective and we also hope that we're going to have more Eastern. Medicine perspective interviews on our podcast so we'll be looking some of those this year but more about this book is she talks about how to start changing your understanding of infertility and some of the misconceptions in Western medicine about fertility issues. Also, she talks about a discovery process for how to determine what specifically might be contributing to your infertility diagnosis from a Chinese medicine perspective. She talks about the Chinese medicine approach to restoring fertility, including balancing your energy changing your eating and lifestyle habits and using acupuncture and Chinese herbal remedies, and lastly. She talks about how Eastern medicine can support Western medicine diagnosis such as luteal phase defect premature ovarian failure PCOS endometriosis fibroids immunological disorders like autism. immune conditions and male Factor infertility So this is an amazing resource for those who are interested in seeking answers outside or in addition to Western medicine. And if you're considering or using acupuncture for fertility, or you're interested in Chinese herbal medicine, this is definitely for you. And like I said, we don't have a podcast interview yet with dr. Lewis, but we're hoping that she'll be on the podcast this year. Yeah this book. I really enjoyed for kind of how she showed the before and after in particular. Certain patients that had specific Western medicine diagnosed issues like luteal phase defect she kind of shows like the before and after of what a chart looks like prior to treatment and after treatment so you can really kind of see the impact of how something that Western medicine doesn't really always put a lot of stock in can can really have a profound impact on some of these diagnoses that we just don't have great treatments for in conventional medicine. So I think this book I'll need to read this again just because they're so much Chinese medicine info. In there. It's like it's almost like a little immersion and introductory to Chinese medicine. It's like like the beginning of an acupuncture Masters or something not to make it like overwhelming but you know, she really explains a lot of kind of the process behind how Chinese medicine diagnosis looks at fertility issues and the different organ systems that you might have issues and there's quizzes in the book to determine whether or not it could be like spleen insufficiency. And you know, I'm not I'm not an expert in them. Forgive me if you know more about this topic than I do, but it is really interesting. It's almost like you know and be on the pill where you get a quiz to determine what sort of hormone imbalance. It's like you're taking a quiz to see if you have symptoms that are consistent with some of these organ system energy and balances that acupuncture and herbal medicine can help with so it is a cool resource that we did want to include it here for those that are interested in that Eastern medicine perspective. All right, so that brings us to the end of our infertility and fertility treatment category and our last category on today's episode includes two books and we definitely wanted to include a couple of books on these topics because they are such common issues affecting women's reproductive health. So chronic conditions that affect reproductive Health at some of the two the two most common are PCOS and endometriosis and we have a book each that goes into these so we'll start by talking. About eight steps to reverse your PCOS. That is by dr. Fiona McCulloch, and she is a naturopathic doctor and this book is really aimed at demystifying the whole PCOS diagnosis for women. And as we know from previous discussions on the podcast, and of course for those of you that are experiencing this condition personally, it can be very frustrating and confusing and they're really just aren't that many treatment options for PCOS in conventional medicine. So in this book you're going to learn about At the latest research about what's driving the condition how to accurately assess for and diagnose it and how to work through some positive changes that can reverse your PCOS diagnosis improve your health and also boost your fertility in the process. So we highly recommend this book for any woman who has been diagnosed with PCOS or just based on evaluation, maybe suspect that she might have it or perhaps the practitioner is kind of thrown out PCOS is a possibility. This is a great book to read so we don't have An interview with dr. McCulloch on the podcast yet. But we do have one with another naturopathic doctor. Dr. Kevin oberoi and that covers many of the same topics that are shared in this book and she she really speaks highly of this book in that episode. So you can find that interview with doctor oberoi and episode 56 of the podcast which is relatively recent. So some of you may have had the benefit of catching that one already so that covers our recommendation for PCOS and our last book that were amending this week on the podcast is called the four-week endometriosis diet plan. This is by Katie Edmonds who is a nutritional therapy consultant. So she studied at the same institution that I did. She just got a slightly different certification. So dr. Haley tell us about our last book on end. Oh, yeah. So with endometriosis we know that it's a highly inflammatory condition and so diets going to have a big impact on how we are able to control this specific condition and to Boost fertility. So this is a great book that teaches you how to start making positive changes to your eating habits to support healing endometriosis and it provides an introductory guide introductory guide to approach to understanding the different factors that contribute to endow and it also gives you the typical treatment options that are available for Endo and then it will dive into a 28 Day meal plan that you can customize to meet your Visual needs so this is a great starting point for women who have or suspect that they have endometriosis and dietary changes alone. Like I just said it can have a significant impact on pain relief and improving fertility for were a lot of these women now, we don't have a interview specifically with Katie on the podcast yet, but we do have two episodes about endometriosis. So if you check out episode 13, it's an overview of the And how to address it with functional medicine and episode 14 is an interview with a colleague and a friend of mine who have been using nutrition and functional medicine to heal her endometriosis over the past few years. So that is the end of the books that we recommend so we know that we kind of threw a lot of books that you and don't worry. There are all in the podcast description and also on our website tinyfeet dotco for it / podcast. You can find the podcast link and be able to get links to these books. And also hopefully you get a chance to be able to listen more in depth with any particular topic that sparked your interest to the episodes that we mentioned. The previous podcast episodes awesome. Well, thank you guys so much for being with us again this week and we will look forward to seeing you back next week.\"]"
