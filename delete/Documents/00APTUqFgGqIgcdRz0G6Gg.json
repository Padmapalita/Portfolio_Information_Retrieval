We're going to talk about the absolute most important thing you need to focus on to get results with weight loss. If you have Hashimoto's type thyroid case or just regular hypothyroidism a few Basics. You got the thyroid right here. It's located right in the", " Part of the neck two and a half inches wide. It produces a hormone T4. Okay, the four represents the number of Iodine molecules, so you got four and then you got this T3 over here, right? So T 4 T 4 is an inactive thyroid hormone. It's not active. It doesn't really do much. It's a pre hormone your body strips off this one of the iodine molecules and it converts to T3 T3 is the active form of thyroid hormone. Okay, it's the thing that", " It goes into all the cell's and speeds up your metabolism as well as weight loss and here is the most important thing to get from this tea for two this T 3.
