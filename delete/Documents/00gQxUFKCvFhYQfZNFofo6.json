Yeah and always like a friend would let the cat out of the bag but like roaring I you in the queue like Simone you forgot your and I'm like sure. Yeah, but you still turn around and you're like, hey Ian. Yeah, but now we just did it. I think at that age like when I think back we had the best night out at that age because the majority of us were underage. Yeah, especially in Galway like there's some great bars and clubs and so", " If you've got in the beginning of the night, oh my God, you just knew it was going to be good night because sometimes you just wouldn't get in and then if you'd had success in the Brewers, of course you had to carry on. Yeah and the night always ended in the nightclub. There was no going home after the barriers when you were 16 17. Yeah, so we would always end up in whatever and I killed will take us and always on a real for a night out though. Yeah. Well, it was also good amazing ways to go to like three or four pubs and then we knew all the ones to go to to get the free stamp into the nightclub, you know.", " Get a free stamp in before 12.

She's likely the only thing is is that you'll have to be Pakistani.", " You could make it. Let's give it a go. Oh my God. I know I looked up and the guy just looked at me and looked at the idea and he just laughed he was like, yeah God, I think he's just really voice of person like he was just like this is clearly not yell, but work to charge. I know the thank you f sharp.", " Yeah. Okay. What perfume do you wear? Okay. I know this one's super well because I wore the same over years. I wore YSL baby doll. It was in it was a motive is a little pink kind of not a bottle. It was one of those flasher.

It is yeah, I'm gonna have a look Ray. Yeah, I know. So yeah, I think it's easier to cope with when you know, you want a specific one. You might didn't buy it and leave whereas if you start browsing your like everything's a hundred quid.", " What is your biggest worry?", " My biggest worry when I was 17.", " Oh my God.", " I don't know.", " I don't know what my biggest worry. I don't think I had any I don't think I was very chilled and children were here at college or anything like that. No, no because I'd suck that off. I was not going, you know, Dad you just decided traveling? That's it. That's it. I'm just gonna go away and and my mom was very supportive. I remember she was like look universities and for everyone if you want to work that you can work. Yeah, like she I think my mom's very like me her her parents made her go to university so she went but she didn't she never wanted you to", " I wanted to work so I knew I was kind of like my mom like that and so she was like look if you want to go travel and then come back and get a job and do what you want to do then great. And so I think that if that hadn't happened, yeah, maybe I would have had other worries. I would have been more insecure like what I'm going to do my life and yeah, but no I didn't I was very my mom was great. Like she just said if this what you want to do and I knew when I went away", " That she was upset that I've gone and she must be nothing but she would never show it. Yeah, I wanted to support me. She wanted me to do what I do when I think want to stop you from know and I think about that now like as a Mom myself now, I don't know how she did it. You know. I just want to hold my child to me forever never leave home, but she was great. She was like you have to do what you want to do and figure out who you are. And and so I think around that time I was generally pretty Carefree. I didn't have no worries because I was doing what I wanted to do. Did you think you were really grown up and", " Why? Yeah, I think I was quite independent. Anyway, I'm yeah pretty independent and going away. Like I said, it was a bit nerve-racking but it wasn't enormous stretch for me. I just really wanted to do it. And so I don't know. I just it's just mad when I think about it like how headstrong I was then yes because I didn't have a lot of worries. We don't anyways, most of us, you know, when we're if we're lucky like at that age. You don't really they're not real worried now.", " No things that are never, you know, you live in your mind. It's just it's you know, I'm really glad like that. I lived my best life then I guess I'm to one of my friends but that she actually lives in Kuwait now, but we work together overseas. Okay when we were young and we were talking about it and I was saying God, I'm so glad we live the lives we did then because that's what it's all about because then you get older and then you've got the responsibilities and then the worries and everything coming up that's life. And so", " I'm really glad we had that life because I know some people don't and they do have worries that age and you know, obviously then they grow up and it gets worse. And yeah, so I'm glad that we had no cares completely heedless more like, but anyway, were you ever like were you sensible but money? Yeah, I would I would say like 95% of the time I was sensible. I remember one time I had to call my parents and ask them for money because I'd run out and they were just appalled and all I wanted was something like 50 euros until it was a couple of days.", " Or payday, you know and I just remember like I was so wounded by how disappointed they were. I swore I was like it's never gonna happen again and didn't after that. Oh my God. I wish I was pretty good. Right? I was just really focused on like this is my money for food that he be alive. And then this large portion is for my alcohol. That was my budgeting, you know? Yeah, and then this little bit as for Miss Selfridge and like buying my few bits or wasn't boots. What was it? There was a big chemists we used to go into", " In Galway camera, it was boosted by my bits in there and it's not as pretty good when the last I was pretty good.

I was like, they're giving me I was only working four hours on a Sunday. That was it looking back. It was just because I was like, I'm too hungover. Yeah, sounds like so bad.

I know you're well then I know yeah.", " Yeah, I'm so bad. But anyway, I've kind of learned kinda not can I have that Vault? Where will you be in 10 years? I think when I was that age, I thought", " I thought I would be living away. I thought I would be living overseas. I would be somewhere I would not be in Galway. I would not probably even be in Ireland. I would be away somewhere not not knowing specifically what I would be doing, but I just always had a feeling that I would be living overseas doing something because I just never I do know I never wanted to stay in Galway. Yeah, you know, I just I always remember when we're doing our leaving cert. I just couldn't wait to get out. I just couldn't wait to go.", " All somewhere. Yeah and was Dublin ever not ready? No not running. I just wanted to go away area something else. I wanted to travel and just why did I just wanted to like do something new and cool. And so I think yeah, it's 17. I think if you'd said to me we're going to be 10 years, I would say overseas. Yeah, I no idea where or what I'd be doing but away Adrian always want to go overseas as well or was it just a work thing? Yeah. He led you to he had lived overseas himself on and off when", " We'd met and even when he was a teenager like he'd worked away a few Summers and I think anyway, like most people I know at home. We you know, it's kind of enough. So I think it's Irish people like we all do stuff. We all travel we all have people who've gone to Australia or Canada and states or family who have emigrated or whatever, but I know it's kind of the done thing now, it's very you have to take the year at some point. Yeah. I'm not sure when you do it, but but yeah, he suppose we're quite like minded like that. So he liked traveling and doing new.", " - so did I and so just kind of wasn't a big thing when something came off and we started to live away. It was like yeah cool. Let's do it. Whereas obviously like I remember telling my mom we're moving to Singapore and she was like, where's that I know but where it's gonna take me 24 hours in a flight and I'm like no, it's only 12. Yeah. Did she go? Yeah. She did she come out a few times. Yeah, but it you know people at home and they say just the shock of a yeti mean why but it's nice when you move away because then your parents actually go then", " Because of visits things and yeah, you know and yeah, it was great like oh God excitement when somebody was coming to visit as well. I was just oh my God. Yeah, we'd be there like none of us could come. Yeah Darby and we'd all be like, right. We'll have a roast. Let's show that we're actually doing okay everybody wash.

Yeah, but like being in a different.", " Country without scare me so more. Yeah it let mean I know on paper it was very hard. But I think when you're in a like we certainly didn't have time to think. Oh my God poor us. I can't believe this is happening to us. I can't believe we're here and we've no family and we just got on with it. I can certainly wasn't what I had envisaged. I had. I mean we were supposed to not be in Dubai in the first place just work and different things have changed. We ended up going to divide the last minute. I was supposed to", " To have Charlie in Bahrain. I had my guy knee and the hospital and I my mom was supposed to fly out the week or two weeks before he was born and it just all went wrong. Like we ended up in a different place different hospital. My mom broke her foot a few days before she was due to fly out. She could come out and so this like series is chain of events occurred in the home. So you must have been like, yeah, we just yeah, but it was weird because I mean you really do just go into this.", " You know, it's fight or flight like you just go into survival mode. Like this is what it is. I was very aware of, you know, the impact of stress on babies and this kind of stuff and so I was very calm and we just got on with it and we had him and I had him in the hospital by it was just the two of us and my husband had to go back to work like straight away. Like there was no he just started his job. And and so we were just alone and you know, but but the thing is when I say these things like I don't", " I don't know having a baby any other way. Yeah, you don't know what a difference that's just yeah. I know I can talk to people or read in a magazine or whatever about people having their kids with their family around this and I think I was not nice, but I have no experience of that. So, I don't know. I don't have I don't have any other you don't have regret or jealousy or Castle just like because I don't visit it is what it is. That's what happened. You know, we did our best I think obviously when things like that happen to people there's a lot of benefits in that you become very", " You know tough and you're able to do whatever and you just get on with it and obviously there's a lot of downsides as well. But like I don't know I think we just we were brilliant when I get back like we just flew through it and we did what we had to do and I remember like when my mom came out, I think the first time she met Charlie he was six months. I think the first time she could find I remember she was very upset because my best friend had been out before her to see awesome and you know, just the way it was and I remember any show my best friend saying to me like your poor mom. She's so upset. She brought over stuff for me for my mom.", " - I know but you're not this is life. Yeah, it's just it is what it is. You'll see him at six months. He's like no need to reach out and he didn't know it was fine. It was fine. And you weren't working that because you just moved over. Yeah. I'm sorry leave was Grand. I had gone we were living in Bahrain and I was working for grazia the time and I got a maternity leave like people do and I had planned to go back at whatever point and then we moved we", " We left we're hurrying and we ended up in Dubai and I thought my God like because nothing went to plan. Basically we weren't supposed to be where we were and nothing was turning out. Right? And so I had to go back to work. I think three and a half weeks after he was born or four weeks after he was born and that was hard. Just trying to do childcare and like in a city that we didn't really know like when we were in Bahrain we used to visit to buy but it was like for fun, you know, yeah, he would go over for a night out or to see friends or do something but almost yeah.", " Yeah ever. Yeah, it wasn't like normal life stuff. So yeah, I had to go back to work very early and that was kind of hard but in another way, you know again, we just got on with it. Like I never remember sitting and thinking this is so unfair. There's no other option than to do upstairs. Yeah, you know, I certainly never remember thinking like God. I wish we weren't here. I wish we were at home or I wish I had my mom or I wish you know, it just it just was what it was and we just got to stay strong. I would be in self-pity mode.", " Stopping people on the screen now, but the thing is you have a tiny baby. Yeah, and so you just really it sounds clich\u00e9, but you really don't have time. You just don't have time like he has to nap two or three times a day has to be fed needs to be changed and you're worried all the time about you know, is he sick as he would temperatures if you go here and there and you just don't have time. Yeah, you know you sleep when you can and you try and look after yourself and and that's it. I could just that just became normal. And so yeah. Yeah, but it's funny like I", " I suppose when I hear myself sometimes like I talked about this on a different podcast like a couple of months ago and I remember to sit back and thinking kind of such a hard-ass like the way I was saying it like it was fine. You know, of course there was times where I was upset and things like that, but we just didn't have any other. Yeah way to go about I suppose it was like the long time ago Naomi that it you kind of, you know, yeah, it does feel I mean I do remember obviously, I remember everything very clearly, but it's not something that", " You look back differently now. Yeah, it just it's just one of those just a stage of our life that we went through and then that was it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

She's really she is there she is helping", " She is the person that you can ring off at any time of the day or night and say this has happened. Yeah, and she just is brilliant like that. That's just how I told her she's coming at Ya, so I think I have a little bit of that. Yeah, just in terms of what happened with us from your way and having charity and everything kind of learned that for my mom. I think it was probably in me, but I didn't know I had it or that I would have to utilize it. Yeah, but you do because you learned it from somebody else and so yeah as I've got older like I'll hear myself saying", " I think we're doing something and I think my God, that's exactly what my mother would have. Yeah, but now I like it. Yeah, I don't think I could ever I notice things I'm like, oh, that's actually I like that. Yeah, you know, yeah, she did a good job. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Yeah go moms, but she loved you to go back to go away. Yeah, probably I mean, you know, we love God we both of us because you know, I grew up there Adrian spent a lot of time there and it's such a cool City. We've all got friends there. Obviously.

Okay, so I'm going to ask you the same questions, but now answered. Oh great.", " Eight and got the time very juicy. So your favorite makeup product. Okay. I was thinking about this earlier so", " I would say now my favorite product being sensible like a Fail-Safe always have it not particularly glamorous, but something I would use every single day is my Bobbi Brown corrector my under eye corrector really I've used it for years. I would say over 10 years. Now. I never don't have a I always have us I bought it everywhere. We've been I just think it is incredible. Like if I only had one minute in the morning, I would slap that on and a bit of mascara.", " Because it's just fantastic and I can't be can't be duplicated. Still nothing. I've tried other ones. Yeah, I've tried the Charlotte Tilbury one, which is good. But still a bit oilier. Where's the Bobbi Brown was tiny bit dryer and I think that's kind of why you need so it will stay where it is, but I always found like even years and years and years and years ago when I was working as a makeup artist a lot of women that I would work with really didn't need concealer. They were using concealer because they were trying to cover blue veins under their eyes or a shadow in a corner. Yeah. Whereas a lot of the time if you", " Use a corrector that does the job for you. Yeah, I guess Jan Cedar is then kind of like I would use consider for kind of General brightening and stuff like that. I use consider every day, but the corrector is my failsafe free. Oh, yeah, I think they're phenomenal you have you tried the Becca under eye corrector know that's really nice, but I haven't used the the Bobbi Brown one. So, I don't know if this is pink, right? Yeah, the one I have kind of kind of pink salmon color. I don't know if you'd like it actually because it's a bit more oily early. Yeah, I", " Draw your one Leap. I said, I think it's made more to mix with the concealer. Okay, maybe yeah, I might give that one a go. Now there's obviously different shades concealer on me. There's a couple of different shades. And so there are all independently to correct different things. So if you have like blue tones or yellow tones or like purplish red tones, so there's a different one to counteract each tone. So I've always had like blue toned Shadows or blue tone veins under my eyes. So I have this", " Salmon colored it's called light to medium bisque and that just kind of cuts through it and then brilliant. It's just fantastic. That's my that's the product future. I really wasn't expecting that. Yeah, I know be very sensible here getting are getting all the cheese today. Okay on a weekend. What time do you get off bus and seven half six seven. I have a child, you know, this is still guys.", " Oh wait, I'm a mom. Yeah, exactly. That's my life now and I can't like even if I'm away for work or if I'm away in a friend's or would I my body will not show you sleep in no. So even on a normal day. Maybe we have seven I might sleep in until just yeah like normal days like weekdays I get up at 6:00 a.m. 6:00 6:30 a.m. And then weekends, you know Charities are alarm clock. So he gets up at 7:00 most of the times we would at the weekends we would get off at 7.", " Our Christmas is he like upper the crocodile? Yeah, he would be I don't know. He's a good sleeper. Like I mean, I know when I was little I couldn't sleep like when Santa was coming and stuff like that are saying this fuckin Charlie is I don't know. He's great like that. Like we tell him he's very excited, but I think he gets so excited. He just wrecks himself until he goes to sleep with her. So yeah, so I get up at 7:00. I used to change the clock and my mom's alarm clock.", " Okay, I changed it back in a hour and then I would hide it under her bed. Oh my God, you are evil. I had a bear. Oh my God, so my grandparents used to say in those ring the bell and I had a son like I was weird to be and I'd wring it in my grandparents years get up. I wish", " It was a rainy day remember that period of our lives and we were kids like she was nothing like the best day of your lawyer. I know I know. Okay. What is the most expensive thing? You've bought?", " The most expensive thing I bought okay. It's either a pair of shoes or handbag. I don't know. I'm just trying to remember how much each of them were. I think the most expensive thing I've ever bought it was an Alexander wine bag. It's the Rocco. So the bigger one with the studs on the bottom. I think it was I got it in. I got it from that report a a camera for those are saying or if I'd a discount call, but I certainly know I didn't pay full price for a blast.", " A couple of hundred Euro. Yeah, but I still have it. Obviously. I bought it like five years ago. Now I think and I still love us I still keep it in the dust bag. So it's yeah, it's really maintained itself. So yeah, I think that was the most expensive thing and would you be into splurging on one-off items? Are you more like I don't know. I think like I definitely have a few really nice pieces like a couple very nice bags and some nice shoes, but I'm", " I'm really about quality over quantity like I handbags for example, like I remember when mansoureh gavriel first came out a couple years ago. They were real kind of cool small brand and they had these amazing totes these giant like bucket type totes and a lot. I've always loved big tan leather bags that you can just throw all your shit into your laptop and everything and I wanted to get one and so I bought", " One because I knew it would be I just knew it would be good quality because it was real leather. Anyway. Yeah, and I can't have the time. It was like it was it wasn't it wasn't as expensive as they are now because I bought it way when they first came out like maybe three or four years ago now and it was a couple of hundred Euro the to 300 Euro Best Buy ever still have us. I wear it almost every day anytime. I have my laptop with me it goes in that. Yeah and the rest of the year or the other, you know throughout the rest of the time. I don't buy bags like I would never just go", " Browsing and looking at bags. It's always very kind of purposeful. So the man's her gavriel was probably my last big purchase. I remember I bought a clutch couple of years ago as well from there to Port A from Clare V. I don't know if you've heard. I'm sure she's amazing clutch bags and it's a leopard print fold over like a soft clutch. I got it in the sale. I remember it was reduced to like a hundred fifty Euro. Oh my God, that is the only color choices and I go out. Really? Yeah, so I'm really like the bags I think are great.", " Investment. So do I agree? They will always fixed your car chassis under it's real leather and everything. They will last forever especially if you you know, if you look after them as best you can like if you keep them in their dust box, you know, if you can they will last and they kind of look better I think as they get older yeah as well, you know, so I mind I'm always like I'll buy that Chanel because when I passed into my dad was an area that's a different mic.", " Have a like the last bag. I think I bought was.", " Two years ago. I wanted the monster gavriel the bucket bags. The mini ones a black one. I wanted a black cross over bag because I didn't have one and so I bought that and brown hummus and that's the other one that I would wear. If I'm not wearing the big man's bags. I word. Yes, and they wear really well different their bit different. Yeah. So yeah, I would be very kind of strategic. I would want a specific type of bag that I know I would use regularly and so I would buy a really good one.", " You because think about us. Yeah, and I would think about it and because there's no point like a normal or younger you'd buy bags here and there he buys from Topshop you but I'm here and then after a couple months you've been there you buy another one and then if you add it up the money we spent it would might as well hang on and bought because we didn't think like that.
