What's up everybody? This is dig a bit dazed with a toy photographers podcast. We have an incredible episode prepared for you guys. We have the one the only mr. Jason Young on the other line. What is up Jason?", " Dakota how's it going man? It's good. Is it is good man. It's good to have you on I know this is a this is actually one of my personal anticipated episode. So I'm glad that you're able to come on the show and I just I can't wait to get get started here. Yeah, me too. Obviously we've known each other for a while. So it's just like kind of having a regular conversation, but it's really fun to be a part of the podcast and I love everything you're doing the last few episodes of just been awesome. It's cooled.", " Like hear more about community members, but from their perspective and hearing their voice. So it's an honor to be part of the group. Thank you so much, man. I it has been a joy to have everybody on the podcast so far and just the community support has been amazing having everybody be able to throw in their their opinions and their Insight. It's been a real collaborative process. So I'm so grateful to everybody is enjoying it and once more content like", " like this, so we're going to keep doing it as long as people are listening. Absolutely your Instagram account man. Let's talk about how you started your Instagram account and where you kind of dip your toes in the toy photography initially. Sure. I mean, I think it's funny like even going back and listening to some of the other episodes. I think some of our stories are similar in terms of you know, a lot of us are like Star Wars fans and with the force awakens that came out and new", " Wars toys and all those things they kind of reinvigorated kind of the kid in us and at that point I was on Instagram and I started seeing some accounts actually posting toy photography was like leaking into my design, you know account my design world and I was just kind of Blown Away like that's pretty awesome to kind of back up I do as invisible element. That's my company my business. I do animation which call motion design design illustration.", " Branding so I live in that creative space and so I've been in the in the kind of production world, but most on the on the post side, so I'd work with editors and you know create these great shows and then I would package them with graphics and so never kind of behind the camera, but it's something I've always was interested in learning how to use use a camera doing photography doing video and kind of around the same time. That's when all this stuff kind of hit with with Force awakens and toys.", " Okay, people are doing this. Maybe it's okay. If I do it too. I'm an adult but I still have still love it. Right, right. Exactly. And it's so funny man that you started around the force awakens because I feel like a lot of people did I feel like a lot of accounts started around that time. Do you agree? I do I think if anything, I mean there are a lot of guys who've been doing it way before that. I mean we're talking like five six ten years before that even kind of cropped up, but I'd say it's kind of a Resurgence. It was just becoming more well known and I think Instagram", " Umm, you know helps out with just being able to share imagery along with story. I think that was just like the perfect platform for more kind of eyes on it totally and so I got ended up getting a camera which I'm still using my Canon 6D does about like, I think it's 2015 like December of 2015 and really wanted to kind of learn how to use it again understanding kind of conceptually how it works in my video production, but never really doing it myself. So I got the camera.", " And then really was interested in trying to figure out how to do low light photography and I had some figures that I received the first black series figure was the Boba Fett like at that point that I got that for Christmas along with like Darth Maul and some of the OG like original Black Series figures, which I love to this day and I had those and like it try to you know, seeing what people are doing on Instagram with toy photography. I'm just going to do it and see where it goes and", " Just learn as I'm kind of playing with the toys and you know had a couple shots and like this is this is really fun because one I'm around toys and that kind of reinvigorating my creativity. But then also I'm learning as I'm doing it, you know kind of adding something else to the the the tool belt of just, you know, creative tools that I use everyday so nice. So when you first started out, did you have anybody that really?", " Inspired you to take it to the next level. I know that you when I first came across your account you really seemed to have a grasp of toy photography from the beginning and like you said you had that you had that background in media and marketing. And so that kind of gave you a step up on you know, your your journey as a toy photographer. Did you have anybody that you kind of tried to emulate or model your toy photography after and the beginning?", " I think most of it was just like kind of Discovery at first. So I mean obviously, you know, there's there's a lot of guys like everybody I think everybody's mentioned. Sorry bananas for the most part Johnny he was as far as like doing like Star Wars toy photography. He was kind of the first where he already had a kind of his his foot planted in the ground. He's been you know sharing stuff and that was some of the stuff that I had seen that kind of to begin with Captain Chaos five models some of those guys were some of the original ones that I remember,", " And it was cool seeing how they they approached taught photography for myself. I'm like man. I don't I don't usually go. I don't want to go outside. I don't really have these beautiful locations. So I thought what if what can I do indoors and again doing compositing doing that type of stuff for video kind of was like, you know, I can actually do this with a computer screen. I don't need to like print out a background even though that works. Well Ram I can pull up I can choose right now. I can go and find", " Find like 10 images or screenshots from movie and then figure out which one works best for this figure which you know, I like the lighting on this or whatever and then kind of just worked on using kind of the screens for my backgrounds because it's just one less thing. I had to think about I didn't have to build a diorama. I didn't have to go and find an image then print it it was just right there. And so kind of I was trying to just figure out how can I do things efficiently in quick and get something that still looks pretty pretty professional pretty solid so nice.", " Did you coin that phrase did you Rama digital diorama? Is that something that you coined or did someone else kind of coin that because I know that like you said that that's something that you kind of specialize in. Is that something that you made up at the time? I mean, I don't I don't know at the time. I was trying to figure out a good you know for myself a name for like what I could call it and that just kind of I like wordplay. And so that kind of felt right? I think when I used a hashtag.", " I think there might have been like maybe less than 10 people who had done it, but I don't really know there wasn't any kind of like overarching like context of like this is using a screen for background. It just seemed like it was kind of random gotcha, but I kind of started using that because I was like, okay this makes sense and it sounds good too. Well, it's Anonymous. It's synonymous whenever I think of your work always think of well, he's got some sort of digital element involved somehow even if it's a you know, you have the practical", " Dioramas involved you do have that digital effect. And I love that. I do enjoy your your digital dioramas that you do and it's amazing how you seamlessly incorporate those backgrounds into your photos. And I think one of the first ones that I really just stared at for a long time was the Jango Fett and you had him just placed on your table is either desk or table and you had just a lamp positioned over head and he was like had a blaster he was pointing down at the ground.", " I was just amazed. I was like, wow, that just looks so real it looks so it looked in scale and looked able to be understood but it didn't look like a toy if that makes sense. It look real right look like an actual, you know a performer or an actor on a screen. So yeah, that one's that also like exactly everything you're talking about. I think that's what I find so but like I get so much joy out of with this hobby is like how do you take a figure that may look amazing? Like a hot toys figure or", " or you know mezco stuff or really anything Black Series take something that already looks pretty good. But how do you kind of sell this this shot or how do you sell this concept and doing things like trying to marry a background with foreground elements with the you know, the subject in the center and bringing in lights that match the background color. Once you kind of get all these of like kind of elements together you can really", " The the visual pretty pretty easy. I mean because even if you've got something in the foreground, it's going to give you it's going to give you more depth if it's blurred out. It doesn't really matter. It's just something there and it makes you feel like you're actually within this scene in that it also helps with scaling to of course, but yeah, it's so much fun and in for me every time I set something up in my head. I'm like, okay, I think this will look pretty cool. But you don't really know until you get behind your you know, the camera like if you're looking at your display.", " Say or looking through the lens or even getting it on your on your computer to edit. You don't really know how that's going to look until you you see the shot and that's what super exciting even if you set it up, you know where everything is, you know, what elements are are being used. It still feels kind of like at this surprised when you actually get that that final shot that you can kind of work with so, it's fun. It's addicting man levels. It is so addicting.", " Do you feel like you have improved your process and your workflow since you first started out do you feel like that time frame that you have? I know both of us have time constraints on you know shooting. Do you feel like your workflow has kind of changed the way you approach toy photography. Are you more methodical? How do you feel like that's changed? Yeah. I think it's that's a real that's a good question. And I think there's a lot of things that have kind of ebbed and flowed from the beginning, you know, really dialing in kind of the did your drama technique and then", " then from there like at the beginning it was just like mostly using maybe a floor and in the did Rama image on the screen and then the figures but then I kind of started pushing out a little bit more maybe using more kind of physical props just kind of fill out the scene and then you know while after that maybe it was more about hey a lot of these guys are using physical dioramas and they just look really good in that being more the focus with the subject. Maybe still using the screen for a sky", " Or just to cast some color right? And then then it's like well, I really want to do an all you no, no no screens want to try. What is it? What can I get with just a full diorama pieces or you know, it's fun to kind of just kind of play around with different different techniques. I'd love to kind of do more, you know, kind of outdoor explosion type stuff, that'd be fun. But it's just a little bit more difficult to actually make that happen. But yeah.", " Yeah, it's so much fun. You guys they do that. Sorry. Go ahead. I was gonna say it's just so much fun to play with different techniques and again being inspired by all the amazing guys here doing other things that I'm not focusing on. Yes. It's incredible it is and you know with the people that are able to go out and do the outdoor photography and you know versus the people who are not able to do that, you know, it's it's a different workflow like people that are able to have that, you know,", " environment where they can manipulate every single and you know setting and every single every background, you know, like you were saying, yeah, you're able to control the end product so much easier versus going out in the elements and you really have to have a feel of how the day is going to go when the lights going to be there and it I feel like, you know, not saying that one is better than the other because they're they're two entirely different types of shooting but I feel like when", " are able to go out, you know outside in the elements that you you know, it's almost like it's almost like painting, you know, like painting a portrait but you have no idea where it's going to go. You know what I mean? Like, yeah, you don't have you really have an idea you want to feel you have an emotion that you want but you really don't know because there's so many variables when you're out in the elements universe is shooting indoors and having those shots you're able to you know, you're not be like it control exactly and people that are able to do the outdoors.", " And able to control and master it. It's amazing. It is really is it's a different level for sure. I've tried it many times and I don't feel like I've succeeded so far but I definitely enjoy doing it. Yeah, I feel the same way sometimes honestly, so those guys props everybody who goes outside and shoots. Yes, you're incredible and inspiring so keep it up incredibly inspiring for sure for sure. So do you approach toy photography for the enjoyment?", " Enjoyment aspect of the process or do you do it more for the posting? Because I know a lot of people enjoy the process of toy photography more than they enjoy like the community aspect and then some people love the community aspect more. What do you feel like you enjoy more the nice thing is that I actually enjoy both sides of it. I'll gladly answer your question. But know the process to me is exciting again being more kind of creative minded. I", " Of to I mean just the whole process and trying to figure out how do you how do you get the shot? Trying new? Like I said tick Trips Trips tricks and techniques or even just new new tools. So if you're using like practical like fog or smog in a can or things like that seeing seeing how that changes what you can produce I love that side of thing. I love the creative like being the", " Creator and in bring it all together and seeing what you come up with but I would say what keeps me in to a photography is the community not necessarily posting the final shot and getting you know comments and likes and all that stuff. But it's this type of thing where you and I we met over our love for toys, right and we're talking about it and it's something that I think everybody needs something that they're passionate about that. It's not about making money. It's not about getting notoriety. It's about something that you just", " I love to do and knowing that there's another you know, there's a ton of people who come from different walks of life that do this and we have this really great Community who loves to share and who loves to be inspired by one another lift each other up. That's what keeps me in it because I mean it at the end of the day if you're only going off of what your return on investment is, like if you want to put it that way sure there are some shots where I'm", " Like hey, this is a great shot and it gets like 230 likes Ryan some other ones get over a thousand or whatever it is. It doesn't really matter the numbers. But if you're just basically kind of going off those metrics then at a certain point you can be like, okay. What why am I doing this? Yeah, and the reason for me is the community in the relationships. So I love that. I love that, you know having that burnout kind of happen whenever you're trying to just gain momentum in likes or", " Is it yeah, it's exhausting and it's a never-ending goal. You know, what I mean? Like is 10,000 going to be enough 20,000 30,000. When is it end? And at the end of the day like you said thing that's the most enjoyable aspect for me to is being able to you know connect with people like you like minded people who enjoy the Hobby and who enjoy creating content that's going to inspire and uplift and be able to you know, I love what Jesse said on the previous.", " You know, he does a picture and a help somebody through their day and it just gives them a little boost, you know, and that to me is worth it, you know the investment that I made figured that I purchased a diorama I made by hand or whatever it was that to me was worst, you know that investment. And so that's amazing me I love this community people that don't really understand the toy Community maybe that are looking out from the outside and and I just encourage you just to get in.", " I lived in the people that are out there putting out great content there so accessible, you know, if you want to be able to learn just send us a message and we will help you man. Just be approachable. Of course, you know be respectful, you know, you don't want to yeah, you don't want to foster a community. That's disrespectful. That's something I definitely don't want to have especially on, you know, our personal, you know pages that we like to do like we want to be respected and we will show you respect as well. So yeah.", " Yeah, and that's that's another thing. I would say just in general the community is great at sharing at interaction inspiring uplifting. But also, yeah, you're right. I think everyone recognizes the amount of effort that we put into our own work in so even if somebody's inspired like oh, wow, that's shot that you did was great. I want to try that too. And a lot of times people will attempt it and say hey I was inspired by so and so you go check out their work and so over and over again. I'm seeing more of that.", " Type of attitude versus okay. I'm blurred in this new thing. I learned what looks best as snow like what what is it flour or baking soda? I figured this trick out this technique now, I'm not going to share it with anybody. Like usually it's right opposite. Like hey guys, I checked check this out. This is what it looks like with flour. This is what it looks like a big mess on whatever it is, you know, people are so so willing to just engage and like you said, usually if somebody gets used me a DM and I see it like I'll reply and say Hey, you know that", " X4 reaching out. Even if it's just asking a simple question or whatever it might be. So again, you know, obviously you give people respect then that's how you'll get respect to so exactly love the community love the community me too, man. So I'm curious. How long does it take we kind of talked about this earlier about your process. How long does it really take on the timeline that you have a shot in your mind till you get the shot?", " Ready? Sure, you get the process going and then it's able to be posted. Like how long does it take you because I know it takes me you know, let's just say I have an idea I'm always got ideas. Right? So we're all as toy photographers. We always have ideas and shots that are kind of like maybe a bucket shot or a shot that we've been wanting to do. But whenever I set up and from that timeline, it normally takes me about 10 hours from being able to shoot and edit and then post how long does that take?", " Take for you to do. I'm curious. Yeah, I it's fun because I kind of experimented with it a little bit. Obviously the more you do a certain technique the the more efficient you become or if you're able to, you know, keep things set up overnight or for a few days like you're shooting in a room or something and you can just leave all the lights up that makes the process a little bit more, you know more efficient I guess but you know, honestly, so, I'm sure most people I like this too. I mean, I'm also a collector I love just", " Having the toys and being able to have them in my office like as I'm working. I usually have like a few figures that are on my desk in front of my in front of between am my computer monitor and it might be a few figures that I've planned to shoot next and they're just kind of there and I might if I'm waiting on some client feedback or just need to take a little break take a figure maybe pose. It just see what I can do with the figure and you know, that kind of helps me before I actually get to setting up the the shot.", " That helps me kind of visualize. Okay. Oh this you know, maybe get Spider-Man in a certain pose and see what angle works best. Like, what's the best silhouette if he's you know, all crouched up and he's got his arms out and is one leg is forward and one's kind of bent back behind them. Like what angle provides the best silhouette so I can I can kind of do that while I'm in a sense like during the day like while I'm working more or less good and so I usually will have a figure there that helps me kind of", " Just while I'm coming up with the idea help me feel like once I step into the room when I'm going to start shooting. I've got a couple of options from they're setting up depending on what I need to do. It can take maybe 30 minutes to an hour just to kind of get everything right and then take a few test shots, see how things are looking and then maybe, you know do some adjustments and then after that I'll probably spend two hours if maybe maybe more maybe less depending", " But when I set up I like to get more than like one or two shots, right? I want to use that set up again. I like efficiency. I like to get as much out of it as possible. So maybe even uses the same setup with like the Cantina or the Smugglers retreat but shoot for different figures that work with it with a similar setup or maybe different angle, maybe change the color of the light. So it doesn't feel like the exact same thing. So I you know kind of just depends but I did this all at night after", " My family's kind of gone to bed. So I've got a little time where I can just focus. Nobody needs me. I don't have to you know, I don't do it in the morning where I only have like 30 minutes before I have to take kids to school. So I've got time and it's really up to me like how late I want to stay up to it and it just rains it's the morning so do that get the shots and then once I maybe it's the next day, I'll pull all the shots off the camera and put it on my computer. I use Photoshop to do a", " the editing the raw editing and and adding effects and all that stuff. That's just what I've done for years. So it makes the most sense and I'm I'm fast at doing it and then I'd spend maybe for each one maybe 30 minutes just to touch up most of the time. I'm sure all you guys can can can relate there's always tends to be like dust or Little Fibers or things like that that you don't see until you actually blow up the shot on your screen you like. Oh come on or like a reflection of like the hyper real.", " It's better that I just shot reflections of the ceiling fan in his helmet, you know, like stupid things like that. You don't notice until you actually get it up in your working on kind of the editing side. So, you know spend anywhere between like 30 minutes to maybe an hour on some of the individual shots, but then I've got, you know, five six shots from that session that the shooting session that I can kind of post overtime or save a few and post a few weeks afterwards, but", " Again, just try to be efficient with the time that you're spending because we spend a lot of time doing this. So it's true and I've noticed that you kind of have moved away from your three post theme shots and you've kind of gone more of a individual shot per shot. And when I say that I mean your Instagram layout, so the way that when you look at your feed you used to do the the three-shot themed and is that something that you kind of just over time?", " Moved over just because of necessity or what was the reasoning for that? Well, I it's funny. I still in my mind. I'm always thinking. Okay. I still want to have my rose nice and tidy and actually the last like the Vader in the some of the Power Ranger stuff. I shot recently. I did three of each of those but sometimes what I'll do is so if you kind of go back through once I've completed a row, I'll have like maybe a grouping where it's like to", " on a row and then one kind of straggler and then right above that there will be two more from maybe that session. So there's like a grouping of four and then two that are stacked on each other that might go together or it might be one row that's like completely just random but then I start back up with maybe a full row or you know, it kind of will it will change I'm always using that mindset but I was getting to the point when I was like man, okay, I take shot. I've got to get three shots every time I shoot. Yeah, and it was it was it was just kind of silly and like I don't need to", " This and once people see one shot from the setup. If you're showing the same thing if it's just a little bit different it's not as interesting. So unless they're like really Dynamic and maybe a little bit different maybe the same figure. Maybe I'll just do like one or put now that you can do multiple images in one post you can do that before then you can you know have like five images from the session just in one post. So yeah, you know, you don't want to spam everybody it that can get annoying when it's just the same thing over and", " Over again, so that's true. And I'm glad that you said that because I have attempted to do this three-shot seemed Instagram groupings before and it is exhausting because you know, you do have that one, you know, perfect shot that you had in mind and then you kind of have to frame that perfect shot with two other side shots and it's it does get repetitive. Especially when you're you know, looking through someone's feed and you're like you kind of know, what's the filler shots and what?", " The shots that are like, you know the actor seaside. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And I think for me I've kind of moved away from that to just being able to focus on I love what Trevor Williams always talks about. Is that quality over quantity. Oh, yeah, and he is a master of that phrase. Like he will only post the quality, you know, he doesn't just post the post and something that I kind of look up to him as a as a", " forerunner and that aspect and you know growing as artists that's something that we kind of have to balance and juggle is like I want to post because I want to put for as my creativity but at the same time I want to put out what something that's going to be enjoyable and something that's my best, you know, because you don't want to just throw something out there that it's just filler, you know, exactly. Yeah. So I mean, I'm always just because of the type of personality I am", " I'm always curating everything I post and thinking ahead of what's going to be next or what my row will look like so people still can see that I feel like I've I've gots there's some intentionality behind when I post versus just like here's a shot post. Here's a shot. Here's one right. I still am curating in a sense, but try not to be as obvious with it. So ain't going back to the Mantra of the toy photographers podcast that we are storytellers.", " Eller's that's something that you kind of emulate so well is that you're always telling a story and your shots. It's not just you know, just shots that you throw up there. You have some sort of element of Storytelling that you're doing and there's a lot of emotion. I think that's why so many people are able to connect and to enjoy your content so much and that's one reason I do, you know is just a storytelling aspect and the imagination just kind of is able to run with your shots and you post you know, like right now I'm looking at a dart.", " All shot. That's a portrait, even though there's not a lot of context the emotion that's kind of, you know emitted from that shot. You know, I'm thinking what is he looking at? What is going on? You know, what is he thinking and the storytelling aspect is what I enjoy so much of it. So that's something that I really appreciate from your content. Well, thank you. I mean that's that's what I wrote. That's why I respond to as well. There are times when I'm just posting a figure because I think hey, let's if this was like a product shot.", " But how would that appear? You're not surely focusing on? Okay. What is this this character thinking so there are those that are just nice to kind of like I just want to take a picture of this photo are take a picture of this character and you know set that up and I love that but also, you know that can get kind of dull for me. And so I like being able to take it takes more time, but I like being able to think more conceptually of like, okay, what would be what would be funny to?", " Put this character like what situation would be funny or interesting or how do you bring a couple characters from different universes together in that? Ultimately? I think one people respond better to there's so many people in the community taking amazing amazing shots, and they may just be like, hey, there's the figure beautiful scenery, you know action pose Action Shot whatever and it looks amazing, but I think it's really the stuff that stands out are the things.", " Is that have a little bit of thought and concept behind it? Right? Because it just it's just different from what you know, what a lot of people maybe tend to lean towards but again not taking away from from their craft at all. But I'm just drawn more towards like you said kind of the storytelling or the the thought behind what the scene is I suppose and you know, it's proven that emotion, you know is kind of the key to Long.", " Her memory. So if you have an emotion tied to a shot, you know, you're going to remember that shot and I love when you're able to either get a laugh or a maybe even a contemplatively shot where you're thinking Hmm, you know what's going on here? And that's to me the most compelling, you know content is when you're I'm not the best personally at the at the funny shots. I I tend to deline more dramatic serious. You sure hero pose or", " Or you know Batman standing over something and brooding or right, you know what I mean? But but the people that do the people that do that, you know, the funny shots like you've been doing a lot of great content with that that hyper-real Darth Vader which is so funny with the the little things that you included in those shots. Do you do you feel like there's some people out there you want to give a shout out to that you love that are the more humorous Instagram accounts. Yeah. I mean, I think obviously there's a", " Two guys that I kind of run run with quite a bit. So every day I'm talking with Spencer with sweet pics Isaiah Takahashi. Yeah, but look sirs. I joke, I sometimes will I call on black seriously? But yeah is that it's good. Yeah. Let's see Richie Sonos rain and Jack's plastic action.", " I mean everybody if you're in the community, you're familiar with those guys. I talked with them regularly like probably every single day those guys each one of them they inspire me and again, I think so much. It's not really even like one person or you know, three people if you asked me to tell you what are the top three people that inspire you or whatever that I stress out even thinking about that because there's so many people who I greatly admire greatly.", " Who are doing such great work and even people who are building their own dioramas and focusing more on that people who are building little props Dwayne shoots toys recently. He's been doing it at he's always been doing really elaborate setups, you know, you can you know, printing out the wallpapers and posters and all these making these little little props that are just they're gorgeous like", " Again, that that's inspiring to see there's people who are doing Lego toy photography that are just insane the amount of time. It takes to build like a Lego diorama. I know in in light it and that type of stuff or like I said, even the Practical going outside and figuring out how to shoot with fireworks or indoors with diorama. So there's there's so many guys doing it and I think there were call it speaks for itself.", " So the ones that are humorous the ones that take it more seriously the more that a indoor versus outdoor, there's just there's so many great talented folks that might get to talk to and and kind of been our estimate so an inspired by so nice I tend to I guess I don't put people in boxes. I wasn't meaning that at all should not sure what I meant was just really when I ever whenever I think of people that are you know,", " No humorous. I think of like the hot Kenobi's or like yeah, I think of you know, like you said you mentioned plastic action. He's got some great shots that always crack me up with his plastic Ballers shots that he does and you know, when you when you Branch out and start doing different themed shots, you know, it doesn't really put you in a box because toy photography is Limitless. There's just endless amount of creativity that you can put into it and", " For me personally, you know, I you know, I toured a gravitate towards the more humorous ones because sometimes you know, you may be having a tough day. You may be having you know, something serious happened in your life and seeing a shot that's going to crack you up is take you away for a second and from reality and you know, just lighten your mood a little bit and then you're able to get back into the day. Yeah, that's something I enjoy so I'm curious just kind of", " of changing topics here shortly. We mentioned in a previous conversation between you and I you know, our our love of Star Wars the Black Series that lined the a figures do you consider that to be your favorite line of figures to shoot or do you have another favorite line of action figures and you know, what is the reasoning behind that? I'm curious? Sure. I mean, I would probably I would have to say the Black Series line has been my favorite it kind of got me.", " Do it Star Wars is my favorite IP and there's there's there's so much content that you can shoot around in the Star Wars universe. So I've got a lot of those figures. I mean, I've got almost almost all of them got slowing down a little bit. But those those are just fun to shoot at the price point, you know, 20 bucks a pop. Sometimes you get them cheaper than that and you know, you find good deals. It makes it easy to kind of expand your collection.", " Even without like completely breaking the bank. I wouldn't be able to shoot just like strictly hot toys or 1/6 scale like some of these mazing other guys jobs to those that can right, right. Yeah. I am blown away. So the six-inch line the Black Series. I've got the most of that. So as a collector those are fun to shoot but you know over the years just being in the community and seeing other people. You know, what", " Love I mean, I know you you love all the mezco stuff. Like that's you know, the 112 you love you love that and so seeing guys like you shoot that stuff. It's inspiring because of being in the community. I'm was aware of it. I've got I've all I've got only got three of them. So I've got the Spider-Man homecoming Spider-Man The Wolverine the brown and yellow and then the Gomez and there they are incredible. Obviously, you know higher price point.", " But they are incredible figures so they are as much as I love just like the black serious stuff.", " And Marvel Legends, there's so many lines that are just they're inspiring and again, I don't like doing just one thing. And so if I'm in, you know, just shooting one line of toys. I get bored with that easily. So kind of branching out doing other things outside of Star Wars. I mean, I love Ninja Turtles growing up and I the the 1990 NECA stuff that they put out those figures are incredible. They're just like the", " Perfect sculpts and Recreations of the figures and I don't shoot them much but I have them and I love them because of what they kind of do for me in my Nostalgia and what I remember but you know again like the mezco stuff so highly articulate highly detailed I should say. Yeah that they just look amazing in shots. So I like variety but if you were going to say like what's you know, what's the thing? I collect most it would be definitely Star Wars Black Series stuff.", " Gotcha. So you're more of a 1/12 scale kind of guy versus the 1/6. I know you have a few hot toys. Yeah figures. So do you prefer to the shoot? The 112 versus 1/6, I would say yes, because a lot of it kind of logistically with having scaled, you know scaling up.", " Sometimes that could be more challenging than having more like diorama set pieces that are to 112 even if you need something like a little sofa or whatever might be like, there's like 112 like scale dollhouse accessories, you could buy or you go to the Hobby store and grab things. So sometimes it's easier to get that type of stuff and I'd say it's kind of the primary line that I collect one for price, but also kind of availability of", " Other like other props and things then also it's just it I feel like you can you can either go really tight and get some nice like medium or tight close-up shots of the figure at that scale or you can go really wide and see more of the scene when you go up to like 1/6. I feel like you're kind of in maybe a little bit tighter, but you're able to see more details and they look so good so but yeah one 112 is problem my go-to for sure.", " Nice nice me too, man. I love the 1/12 scale and I've kind of you know gone back and forth. And I tend to have a rabbit Trail mindset whenever I'm looking at figures or pre-orders and I'll get excited about a certain line and then I'll remember. Oh, yeah, there's this coming out to and it's as a collector. It's impossible to be able to keep up with every single line and every single series of characters and I think that's one of the more enjoyable aspects of the", " Photography Community is being able to see other people pick up figures that maybe you were interested in but you just didn't pick up because of budget constraints or whatever. It may be and then you see them doing those shots that you maybe you had in mind. I've seen that happen many times. I was like, oh I wanted to do that Shawn. I'm glad they did it and it's not like I'm jealous at all. I'm actually happy that they made the shot that I wanted to make and so I don't have to in my mind go out and purchase the figure because someone did it, right exactly. So it's", " It's funny to look at it from that aspect and enjoy photography as a community and as a creative collaboration. Yeah, it really is. It really is.

You've been working on for the last few months, right? Yes, let you tell us a little about a little bit about what it is that we collaborated on together. Okay? Well, I'm gonna have to go back to the very beginning so man. I was working at a factory couple years ago and was just kind of I saw this post and my friend and you know, she's like an", " Little person and was like, you know, if you want to like move on with your life like you really just need a dream yourself out of the old season and into the new I know that super-spiritual maybe people who aren't like into spirituality whatever. I'm just like, you know, just ignore this segment, but I was like, okay, how do I do that? Practically speaking? How do I dream myself out of my old season and into a new season, so I was like, okay. I love toy photography. I love action figures. I love dioramas boys. Wanted to make dioramas and I", " Just grew up in a very creative household always creating always making things by hand and I love Star Wars 2. So I just kind of started just daydreaming while I was working at this Factory and I was like, what could I make, you know, maybe be cool to make a Star Wars, you know diorama that people could you know, not only recreate certain scenes but use as you know multifaceted experience to be able", " all to you know, create scenes like with the black series figures are figure arts. And at this at this real quick at this point, you've already kind of been a part of like the community so you'd see yet people doing tweet ography and probably building dioramas as well. Right I had and I was you know, at the time I was not as involved in the toy photography aspect. I was more in the to the creative aspect of creating things and so it kind of you know,", " Goes back and forth and that process and so what I did is I had reached out to you and I think I've reached out to a couple other people. I've just kind of picking their brains about you know, how do I do this? If I want to do this? What do I do? And you had hooked me up with was figure works and he let me just say is the most incredible dude hands down really it is such an incredible guy. So humble so approachable and I just reached out to him. I was like dude I have", " this idea. I want to make a diorama that's based off of you know, the Cantina scene in A New Hope and he was like, okay. Well, this is what you have to do and you just started laying out all the framework and you know, you know, long story short. We basically started brainstorming and we had we had a product that we could be able to create and so he gave me the scene specific dimensions for for the scene and I was so grateful because he", " All of this knowledge and I was able to just take that knowledge and be able to create and you know, I went through a couple of different processes and creating there's different versions that we made along the way and we came up with this modular version of the Smugglers or treat man. It's just it was so much fun to be able to do that process and now so moving into the process of actually pre-orders and everything sure that was that was a learning process.", " Is that was annexed random that was extremely fun. But also taxing learning process because I had to just be glued to my phone for every DM and every single, you know opportunity to respond to customers potential customers. And you know, I'm I was learning I was you know, learning the process of how to be able to be an independent diorama maker. And yeah, so so if I may I would say the other the other thing about that is that when you started and we started you know you", " You sent one to me. We started shooting it along with a couple other guys and really it kind of opened our minds up with it being modular and kind of creating these different scenes taking those shots giving them back to you and it helped you have things to actually put forth important to come in the community and say hey building this together kind of collaborative, you know with with all of us and people could see what they could do with it. And I think maybe part of it was like maybe the", " ation in everything you created was such a high quality. I'm not saying like toy photography just the piece that you created such a high quality that people responded so well to that. I think I mean you it sounded like you got quite a few people who actually purchased and who were just really excited you get reposted several places. And so you just from the beginning you were making a solid product and doing that, you know, and it's", " Thinking, you know the collaborative way that was that was pretty cool to see and be you know, honestly be a part of I was I'm so grateful for the opportunity to be able to work with you guys and the C3 Bros and being able to send you guys those prototypes and you guys gave me some great feedback and I was able to adjust in like some of the things that you had mentioned like for instance the in inside wall.

So that way you could have more opportunity for different shots. And so that was a great feedback, you know learning from my mistakes learning from little things and I make all these by hand.

You know it originally I was slated. I wanted to finish the entire project by summer, but it's kind of I've had some family issues come up and it's pushed back by its pushed back a lot of orders and you know being so involved in my family and my wife's mother actually got cervical cancer and that really, you know, kind of basically halted a lot of production because she moved in with us and we were you know,", " Care of her and so not to get too heavy but just draft process alone for like learning it is and learning how to manage and juggle all of the orders along side of doing a all my other things that I'm doing, you know, it's definitely been a process, but I'm so glad that I never gave up and I never I never threw in the towel because at some points it really was stressful because I want I want I can hold myself to a very high standard and I think it comes from my upbringing.", " Me and my family and I have you know, my grandfather was in sports journalism for 20 years and he's just a master at speaking and and someone that's very influential in his craft and I hold myself to a very high standard because of because of his influence in my life and all these other aspects of my history my family history.

Yeah, you know I had no idea how I was going to do that whenever I put the actual pre-order process up and I didn't actually have that because I remember I had done a different version of it. Would I what I had done was using wood wooden dowel rods right? And those were you know, they were worth", " They were but they were the nice to upgrade what you figured out like all those little details that you added and then some of the 3D printed pieces that you worked with bigger works on like it just again like you're talking about you continue to push yourself and elevate your craft.

And yeah, I think that's another reason why you are also a great pillar of this community as well. And thank you so much. Do you I really appreciate that. It doesn't always feel that way and you know, our minds can sometimes be you know, the worst down worst of critics. And so I appreciate you saying those things.
