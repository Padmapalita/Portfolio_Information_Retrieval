She had lived happily beside her older sisters Guided by hippolytus wisdom and safe under anti appease protection. They loved her fiercely and penthesilea. I adored them in turn the day. She lost them both in one Fell Swoop. The world seemed to come to a shuddering halt. The memory of that day haunted her keeping her awake long in too many nights penthesilea was a member of the Cavalry that had stormed the beach toward theseus's ship as she rode on to shore every cell in her body had been alive with rage.

A torch was passed down a line of Warriors exchanging hands until it reached penthesilea. She stood at the base of the pyre gazing at her sister's still body. I always knew you would die by the hands of men. I imagined being by your side as you fell uttering a Battle Cry with your last breath. But this murdered by thieves you deserved so much better sleep.

I had never known on a radius on their long walks through the streets and tie Abby and Theseus grew closer. Weeks later when he asked anti happy to be his Queen. She was surprised by the certainty. She heard in her own voice it emanated from somewhere deep within her Rising through her throat and spilling from her lips before she could give it a second thought she accepted.

Now back to the story. Penthesilea and mole Padilla traveled across the black and Aegean Seas on a dozen ships with an army of 500 trained and battle-ready Amazon's on board. They weathered storms and turbulent waters for weeks lightning scored the heavens and thunder throttled their ships with every brooding Rumble the Tempest appeared to be a dark Omen sent by the gods themselves. Selves but penthesilea did not heed warnings from any man or God. She forged on determined to reach the mainland within a fortnight as the Amazons approached the outskirts of Athens. They crested a hill overlooking the city. It was just before Dawn and the sun hadn't yet surfaced. The entire Valley was cast in Shadow and a low-hanging. A fog clouded the city's columned buildings penthesilea trotted her horse to the front of their ranks and gaze down at the slumbering city, like wounded prey. It was now or never she signaled to mow Padilla sisters their lies before you the object of our voyage and our training one year of blood and anguish has led to this very moment. Our turn has come to devastate Athens as Theseus has done to a radius. We will avenge hippolyta and liberate and Taya P. We will take our retribution. The Amazons struck their swords against their shields in violent anticipation penthesilea stepped beside mole Padilla and as she approached her Restless Army, she raised a single Palm the cheering Warriors fell silent in just moments. We will descend on Athens like a plague and when the Sun rises over the pin Deuce mountains, we will have stained The Marble City red with the blood of its people we do not return. Her 80s without theseus's corpse strong from the bow of our ship. On my signal release help the Amazons road down the hill into the land below like a crashing wave the Deep low base of thousands of homes pummeling the Earth echoed throughout the valley. The Athenians heard them before they saw them a distant Thunder growing closer by the second Theseus and his generals immediately called their troops to Arms the bells tolled in alarm and the soldiers flew to their stations along the city walls. The Greek soldiers ready their weapons Hearts racing in anticipation of the coming charge. But then suddenly the wave of sound stopped. There was a heavy Stillness unsure of where to aim their arrows. The Greek archers swept their bows across the Horizon peering into the gently stirring missed nothing. The fog was too thick. suddenly an Archer was struck down and then a second and another and then another a shower of arrows then rained upon the stronghold and then finally The blood-chilling cries of 500 women filled the air as the army of Amazon's emerged from the morning fog. They descended on Athens walls howling and screaming like Banshees. The Amazons pushed past the gates to find the Athenian Army still scrambling to organize their soldiers They seized their vulnerability not hesitating to cut down any man in their path an hour later. They had blazed halfway through the city the warrior women fought their way toward theseus's Palace leaving a trail of bodies in their wake the Amazons had expected an entire Legion. Soldiers to be waiting inside the palace defending their King and guarding anti appease cell but when penthesilea and mole Padilla opened the massive doors, they were surprised to find the palace empty the to Amazon's searched the abandoned Hall weapons at the ready listening carefully for the slightest noise, but the only sounds were the echo of their own footsteps on. all floors These Halls are As Dead As Hades. And this Aaliyah there isn't a soul in this place. Let's if theseus's brat is in this Palace than the Beast himself can't be far as penthesilea and mole Padilla Strode through the palace halls and tie a be hid with her son in one of the Palaces innermost rooms. It was perhaps the first time in her life that the once Fearless Warrior felt Terror, but it wasn't for herself. Be still little one for the love of the Gods be still she did not know how penthesilea would react to finding her in the palace holding the child born of a union with their enemy. How could she explain herself? How would she convinced her Fierce sister that she had fallen in love with Theseus and taken a throne by his side. How could she Explain loving a man at all and Taya be grab the hilt of her sword and prayed. She wouldn't have to use it. These yes, do you hide inside your palace with babes while your men die like dogs in the streets coward? You may be king now, but you cannot Escape your sins with an army and a crown you owe me a blood debt. In her rage penthesilea struck a bust of Theseus with her sword sending his likeness shattering to the floor. She heard the infant cry again. They were close the to Amazon's followed the cries to a door at the end of the hall and entered swords raised but as soon as penthesilea crossed the threshold she stopped dead in her tracks. And tie a be stood in the center of the room, her tall frame draped in silks golden cuffs decorated her bare arms and jewels glittered from her neck and pierced ears penthesilea was frozen. She had played the moment. She would reunite with her sister over and over in her mind, but seeing her there standing adorned and perfumed dripping in jewels penthesilea. Felt as if she was in a strange dream and Taya P penthesilea, you don't know how long I have prayed to Ares that I would see your face again. What has happened to you? I swear to the gods if these years has locked you away and made you his concubine. I am no one's prisoner mole Padilla. What are you saying penthesilea watched carefully as untie a be steeled herself to answer as She began to speak tears streamed down her face. She explained that everything her Amazon sisters. Saw the fine silks the chambers and theseus's Palace. They were her choice and hers alone. Neither Theseus nor any man had enslaved her in Athens. This was never your choice and type e you belong in a radius with our people your people you don't Understand my people are here in Athens. I am their Queen. It was so clear. Now. Everything had been there in front of her eyes, but penthesilea hadn't let herself believe it until the words fell from anti appease own mouth. You are no Queen here sister. You are a slave and silk robes come with us to rate here. Us and take your place on the Amazon Throne your people need you. I need you come home. I can't come home Princess Elia. I have a child here a son and tie up be moved aside to reveal the infant behind her cooing in his cradle the realization struck penthesilea like a blow to the stomach leave him and tie up e Men be raised by men come with us. I will not you mean to tell me that you choose to abandon your people in exchange for suckling theseus's are at your breasts. Yes, then you leave us with no choice penned the saleya turned to moping idea. What did she mean but it was too late the fierce General had already hurled her spear. and tie a be stared in disbelief at the spear piercing her stomach delicately holding its handle then she locked eyes with penthesilea the sisters stood Frozen inside a small eternity as the baby began to wail again penthesilea ran to catch her sister and tie up he gazed up at penthesilea as she knelt over her body trying in vain to Stop the bleeding with her bare hands. She opened her mouth to speak but instead of words blood flowed from her lips in the next moment and tie happy was still. Penthesilea stared down at her motionless sister and tie a p the true Queen of the Amazons. Her last sister was dead penthesilea doubled over as sobs racked her body soon her tears mixed with anti appease blood penthesilea turned to mole Padilla rage flooding her senses. What have you done? She betrayed us made a mockery. three of our way of life penthesilea had had enough in one swift movement. She reached for her bow and sent an arrow through mole. Padilla's heart the Amazon sank to her knees gasping in disbelief penthesilea looked on as her General died as the war waged on outside the Alice walls and anti Abby's infant son wailed from his cradle penthesilea sat silent in the blood of her slain sister. Coming up penthesilea returns to the kingdoms of men for the last time now the final chapter of our story after one year of vigorous preparations and training penthesilea, and the Amazons long-awaited attack on Athens was coming to its end. But what started as a mission to rescue their rightful Queen had ended Tragedy more Padilla murdered and Taya p and penthesilea killed her General intern outside the battle between the Amazons and the Athenians descended into bloody. Chaos. As soon as the Amazons penetrated The Heart of the City Theseus collected his troops and fought back with a vengeance the Athenian Army outnumbered the women warriors 5 times over and soon they had them surrounded in Athens Acropolis without their general or their Queen to lead them. The Amazons were almost entirely cornered by the time penthesilea emerged from theseus's Palace. And led her people to retreat more than 300 of her Fighters had fallen in the onslaught the Amazons had suffered a devastating defeat unable to conquer Athens or rescue their rightful Queen. They returned to a radius to recover from the loss and to mourn their dead, but penthesilea would never be the same the horrible Tableau of anti appeased. Death had etched itself into her mind every time the young Queen closed her eyes images of her sister gasping for breath in a pool of blood and silks appeared and when a storm would howl across a radius has forests penthesilea believed she could hear the desperate cries of anti appease infant son in the wind the young Queen was plagued by despair. And wished for her own death, but it was forbidden for an Amazon Warrior to take her own life and honorable death on the battlefield was the only form of self-destruction that penthesilea could hope for she longed for an opportunity to sacrifice her life to Aries and clear her honor with blood and soon she received her chance. On the coast of the Aegean Sea the kingdoms of men were waging a long and ruthless battle when Paris Prince of Troy and son of King Priam abducted the beautiful Helen the Spartans came and lay Siege to the city. The Trojan War had begun Troy had recently lost its Champion Prince Hector to the Invincible Achilles who fought on the side of Sparta. In the wake of Hector's death King Priam was in desperate need of an ally to support the Trojans in his stead. He searched high and low for any man to come to their aid against the Greeks, but it was a woman who heeded the call. Penthesilea agreed to sail to Troy to fight on the side of the Trojans, but on one condition she would go alone. Amazon's historically did not fight in men's battles and she refused to involve her people in what was ultimately a foolish squabble over a beautiful woman penthesilea had been waiting to cleanse her soul on the battlefield and join her sisters in the afterlife. If King priam's request delivered that opportunity to penthesilea on a silver platter fighting the indomitable Achilles was a suicide mission and she would not bring another Army to Greece just to be slaughtered but when penthesilea announced her plan to leave a radius to fight the war of men she was met with resistance her people insisted that they accompany their Queen. And soon 12 of her best warriors stood pledging to die alongside her in battle. They were a Nia whose name means swiftness Alka be and anti broght Bray Musa whose name means raging female cleat and dairy makea dairy. No boy the Dark-eyed heartmath oi and pull a Musa Therma Dosa her most skilled. Warrior with a spear and entendre whose name means one who goes before men. The very next morning the small band of Amazon Warriors sailed the Black Sea for Troy Days Later penthesilea noticed that the once Blue Horizon had begun to burn read as their ship drifted closer to shore. The horror of the Trojan War came into terrifying View. the city glowed Crimson with the Flames of the burning City The Faint screams of soldiers and citizens alike could be heard in the distance in the Trojan Port the Amazon sailed through a smoking graveyard of obliterated ships penthesilea had always known that coming to Troy would mean certain death, but seeing the devastation of the city laid out in front of her was something else entirely The heavy reality of what she had brought her Warriors to face sunk deep to the pit of her stomach sisters. We alone have been gifted with the ferocity of Ares the blood of War runs hot in our veins. Our heritage is Battle and victory our tradition today. We seize our Birthright if we fall it is an honorable death our ancestors call to us. To take our place among them in death. We will see our mothers our daughters and our sisters. We are Amazon's unafraid of battle unafraid of death. Meanwhile in Troy the Spartans had gained the upper hand after Hector's death the Trojan Army had suffered great losses and grown weak in the Relentless battle. They were mere days from surrendering to Sparta. But soon their hopes were revived by their glorious new Ally. Why? Penthesilea and her twelve Warriors rode Straight Into The Fray and Trojans and Spartans alike turn to watch as the fierce women galloped into battle the Amazons crouched forward over the next of their horses long hair streaming behind them their armor glinting in the midday Sun they rode together with an almost unearthly Grace at once beautiful. And terrible the Trojans cheered as the Warriors swept past. Finally, the daughters of Ares had arrived as the two lines clashed penthesilea and her Warriors cut down every Spartan in their path the Amazon queen blazed through the ranks like a wildfire through a forest one by one. She pierced the backs of those who fled and any man that dared to charge her was struck down in a single. Low soon, the long shaft of her spear was streaming with blood. The cacophony of War flooded penthesilea has ears the screams of the injured echoed across the battlefield while the clang of Swords rang through the din in the chaos of the onslaught. She realized that she had lost sight of her Fighters. But as she scanned the battlefield penthesilea saw that her band of Warriors had been thinned to just three then she saw him. Achilles stood taller than any man penthesilea had encountered his bronze armor shown with the fresh blood of Trojans and around him a ring of corpses laid in his wake in the next moment entendre Road in for the attack the Amazon launched her spear at Achilles, but it's Point simply ricocheted off his armor as entendre rode around. The champion penthesilea watched as a kill. He's caught her by the hair and pulled her off her horse, then in one swift movement. He drove his sword through her chest for a moment penthesilea stood Frozen in the churning sea of battle her eyes trained on the horrifying scene before her she had finally seen the man that would Grant her the uh, honorable death. She had longed for penthesilea steeled herself and called to him Achilles beasts among Greeks come stand before my spear or are you like all men Too Proud to face your death? As penthesilea screamed her challenge to the champion the Skirmish slowed and the sounds of battle hushed All Eyes watched Achilles and the Amazon queen the champion removed his sword from the dead entendre and walked toward penthesilea. The two Warriors met each other in the center of the plane. I am afraid of no woman, especially one who chooses. Ride safely a stride her Steed then perhaps you will fear a daughter of Ares on her feet in one movement penthesilea dismounted her horse and withdrew her sword from its sheath. She walked slowly toward Achilles. You walk towards your grave Amazon. I will tear you apart by sword or spear. How would you prefer to die penthesilea replied by striking Achilles? A sword out of his hands sending it clattering to the ground spear. It is Achilles and pendous Alia exchanged blow after blow their weapons falling into a rhythmic Symphony of clashing metal though penthesilea found that she was faster than the champion every hit. She made was futile falling. Useless on Achilles armor. She quickened her Pace dodging Achilles Spear and soon managed to send his shield flying off into the distance. We have Chow stood long enough Warrior Queen come meet your death penthesilea charged achilles with all her strength, but the moment she reached out to strike. He thrust his spear low delivering a blow to her legs penthesilea. Was sent stumbling to her knees repeatedly she struggled to walk but the wound had rendered her immobilo Achilles turned his back on her and began to walk away Achilles. Don't you dare turn your back on me. You are no child of Aries woman, perhaps now you will remember that coward come back and finish what you've started Achilles stopped and turned to look at the Wounded Amazon penthesilea stumbled toward him dragging her sword in the Earth the blood from her maimed legs mingling with the dust beneath. Her feet Achilles was astonished with her strength. What kind of woman was this? What is your name Amazon? I am pet the Cilia daughter of at rera sister of hippolyta and at eiope third Queen of the Amazons. And you will give me a proper fight without a word Achilles sprinted toward penthesilea. And in the next moment drove his spear down through the breastplate of her armor piercing her heart. Achilles withdrew the spear from her body penthesilea remained kneeling but as soon as the blood began to run from her chest, she slowly sank to the ground Achilles knelt next to the Fallen Queen never before had he watched an enemy so closely as they faded and he found himself growing curious. He removed penthesilea has helmet Underneath covered in blood and dust was the most beautiful woman Achilles had ever seen. She laid in all her shattered strength tears streaking her dirt stained face. She cast her gaze to the heavens and struggled to speak at last. Let me have Grace. Penthesilea, the third Queen of the Amazons and the last surviving daughter of at rera was dead. a queen slaughtered at the hands of men just as her sisters had died so did penthesilea but unlike the murders of anti EPI and hippolyta penthesilea is death by Achilles spear was not unintentional as the witness to her sisters killings penthesilea knew what lay in store for her whether her death would be directly dealt by men as it happened when hip-hop Lita was slain by Hercules or indirectly as when entire be was murdered by her own people for falling in love with Theseus penthesilea sensed that her fate would be similar. If she didn't die of men's brutality penthesilea feared she would live long enough to witness. Her people's domestication as the territories of man expanded existing as liberated women was becoming an impossible. Dream, so penthesilea took control into her own hands and Met Death on her own terms continuing to fight men would be endless and futile. The Trojan War was at once her Swan Song and submission. Penthesilea is death and the death of all Amazon Queens was used by the Greeks as a cautionary tale a warning of what happens to those who Dare to Live their lives outside the jurisdiction of men whether it was due to rage lust or wore these others would meet a violent and we see this in the Greek Mythic script dooming all Amazon's to defeat and death. Despite their courage skill and divine blood Amazon's would never emerge Victorious over men no matter how hard they fought or how much they suffered they were destined to fail and spectacular bloody fashion again and again, but what if the tale of penthesilea represents something else entirely rather than men's Invincible nature. What if penthesilea story Tells of their cruelty the name penthesilea means mourned by the people from the Greek words pentos and Lalo's this implies that instead of a figure to be blamed and feared penthesilea was perhaps a martyr a beloved figure holding men accountable for their misdeeds as she suffers penthesilea holds a mirror to man sins and forces us to look. Look, but the story of penthesilea has done more than reveal. The pain man has inflicted. It is given us a champion. The myth of the Amazons has been resurrected from the battlefield of Troy and proliferated in literature media and even cultural revolutions what once were cautionary tales of feminine Folly have been reclaimed as symbols of women's strength and tenacity. t Thanks again for tuning into mythology will be back Tuesday with a new episode.

On January 30th 2006 a woman entered the US Postal Service processing plant in Goleta California with a plan. She tailgated the car ahead of her and passed through the gate while in the parking lot shot and killed see Fairchild then turn to Malika Higgins and shot her at point-blank range. Next was Nikola Grant upon hearing the shots many of the employees ran to the window to see See what was happening what they saw was a woman. They all knew Jennifer San Marco.

So, why did Jennifer do it? Why did she go to a place where she worked where she found friendship and take the lives of six coworkers? Well, the answer lies in the reason Jennifer was asked to retire and in the stories of those around her Jennifer born December 6th, 1961 in Brooklyn New York went to work at the postal plan after leaving high stress job of police dispatcher in the mid-1990s in 2003. There was an incident at the plant. But that required her to be removed by police. She was found alone in the parking lot kneeling on her car and speaking to herself when her manager Darlene Haynes asked her if she was okay. She replied they pray before they get in Darlene who had worked for mental health clinics in the past called police and told them she needed immediate psychological attention. She was asked to retire. She then moved to Grant's New Mexico where she was known for her strange Behavior. She would And speak to herself strip naked in public shouting to herself ordered food. And we flee the restaurant before it arrived and once tried to obtain a business license to produce a periodical known as the racist press she was known as The Strange neighbor and other than the call made by her former manager. No one seemed to report or try to help Jennifer see something say something according to writings found later in her home Jennifer believed. She was a target of a nefarious conspiracy.
