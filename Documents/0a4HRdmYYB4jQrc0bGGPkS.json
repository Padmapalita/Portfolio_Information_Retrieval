But yeah that I think production was something I was a lot more taut. I had to learn a lot more about how to do a bit more research into that. And what what made you do that?", " Being pissed off at that no producers being about I really always any producers got any original Beats on that. No one hit me sometime cool. I'll just make my own and listen to something and just copy exactly. Oh as close as I could right? That's how I would practice and then eventually I'd started to make things a little bit more original now. I cannot feel like I've got that control over the hose out and so hundred percent man.

I want to bring that more more of that kind of stuff into attention it become more valuable stuff things that can people can take more away from rather than it just being good music that you can listen to you want to talk a bit about that because I was going to ask you now was that was that so close to your heart?

Yeah, so I do this with everyone first one is what was the first piece of music you remember getting hold of for purchasing?", " It's not the first thing that comes to mind is Rich free to black and white was a big album. That was a massive album. I remembered I was like", " I was religiously listening to Rush right? Yeah, but then he's like you just mentioned earlier about like you listen to his freestyle and that's why did you appreciate how much of a Wordsmith he was and his wordplay was mad. I like he was 23.
