", "duration": 17.792283333333334, "transcript": ["Hello. I wish I could sing because my name is Adela, but I can't so let's just say welcome to my podcast again and it's my first episode will who where were talking about finding your mind body and energy? Of course today? I am going to give you a little look into I'll look through I should say My Lens, you know, like the way I see things. So let's just jump right into it before it Mumble on.", "Way too much. So I look at everything as if it's feeding me and feeding yourself to me means. Okay. What am I giving my body today? What am I feeding myself? What am I reading? What am I saying on my walls? What is my environment looking like? What am I wearing? Who am I hanging around? It's everything it's how we build ourselves what we choose to allow to influence us. And so that's literally", " I'm talking about today what I choose and how I choose to shop what I feed myself and I'm going to start this with a poem that I actually wrote and it's a soup that is she little are super short one. So are you a robot? We you designed in a factory?", " No, so why do we consume from factory-made canned foods and fast food businesses then wonder why we struggled to get up in the morning with low or no energy and life force. These Foods were not human made. They were money made conveniently feeding your weakness of being too lazy. They punishment not nourishment designed for illness not Wellness. You want to feel good. You have a body not a machine feed it like it's alive and worth being.", " It real whole food. So you thrive not just survive. Let that sink in for a minute because boom that when I wrote that even I hurt my own feelings, I was like, oh my God, like because as humans do that, we literally like a so lazy like humans people. We're just so lazy and", " I'm kind of talking like myself, but I'm saying where because I don't like to say, I'm not this and that like, you know well together with in this shit together overall. We like trade our money for convenience.", " How crazy is that and half the problem is it's not that like too lazy to cook. It said they're too lazy people too lazy to learn and make time and that's really sad because time is actually one of the biggest things I hear people say they don't have and it's actually not time at all. It's just not their priority. We have to Value something to prioritize it like I value my health. It's mine.", " One priority because we thought that I feel like I can't do anything. Like if I was thinking bad I can't do anything. Right and a lot of people were only realized that when they've gone through something the rain sick or they can't have something and then they're like, oh my God took my health for granted and all, you know, they've ignored little signs that they've body that their body has been telling them.", " That's like being calling them like please look ask me more feed me better do this better and then your body's got to like Chuck this big storm of something else in just to be like, oh my god. Listen to me and that's so true because so many people were like, I need to do this myself, but I don't have time. I like this another whole conversation of how much how much we value ourselves to give ourselves time to do things for ourselves.", " but", " that's a problem in a society that we I think my belief don't value our health enough because if we did we wouldn't trade our money so much for convenience, but that's the thing like you only will not do that. If you value it so much because when you value it, you take more time and care to it. So and in saying that like it's okay when someone", " This is doing it for you. Like we never have to always cook ourselves and go shopping ourselves because I get fed by I go out and my family feeds me too. But I'm talking overall as a whole like daily. The least we can do is have an understanding of what we're feeding ourselves and how to feed ourselves where we can go to feed ourselves. So if I was to get you to see Through My Lens today, I'd say", " look and see everything as if it's feeding your mind body and energy, especially your food because it is and especially your energy to let's talk about that because it's uncommon to hear how important it is because we have all heard that you know, what you surround yourself with you become so if we're talking about that with foods to then what environment do you surround yourself with when you're eating", " Let's think about someone's food that you love.", " For me, that's my mom and my grandma keep that image in mind. And why do we love that food? Because it tastes good gear. But even if it's basic food is good, right because why it's cooked with love again. There is care and passion that goes into feeding you like they actually want to feed you that's their priority they care about you. They like they want to feed your good food when it comes to", " Cafes, for example, we accept like bad behavior because we want to be served and we don't have to do that and digest that because that's that bad behavior. We're digesting we're digesting that like, I don't give a shit. I'm going through Macker drive-through, or I'm going to go to this Cafe to the lady doesn't even smile to me or just because I like their food, but you are you're eating that that's where you're surrounding yourself that energy is going into your", " your food and you're allowing that to affect you and", " This might sound a bit crazy to you. But if you've never thought about this before, but if you pay attention to a next time you go into a place you will notice it. You'll notice how you digest your food differently when someone's made it with love and care and they respect you and they actually have your best interest in mind. But so till you become conscious of what you're eating.", " That energy of that person so about that pause. I got a call and I had to had to hang that up that beer till you become conscious of where you're eating that energy that person is going into your food. So isn't it? Nice like when you see someone love what they're making or their local family business there a cafe there restaurant they care they are passionate friendly all those things. Like that's where I like to support. That's why I like to sit down.", " Didn't eat where they asked me. Do you like your food? Like what do you want some more water? Like what do you know and they're one is really truly serve. You don't hate their jobs and like I get it there's some waitresses that can be nasty or whatever and they're just having a bad day, but that's not good enough because when you're in the hospitality industry, which I've worked in, so I feel like I can see this you put your shit aside because you're serving that person that person is in your best interest. You want to give them a good experience.", " And so when you go to a cafe next go with your gut feeling and lately, I've been like I always am just like, you know what I've already walked in here. It's rude to leave. It's not rude to leave because if I've sat down that person that hasn't said hello to me love give me water or even shown initiative to care then what's going into the food.", " And that's a that's a big bun for me now because I haven't even gone many of I have like probably three places. They love to eat because of the people because then I know when the people are so good. So the bloody food like it's so freaking important and it's not hard to notice. When you go out next pay attention like to the environment of the people and you'll see that's what you're feeding yourself to not just the food.", " And so if we become conscious of where we're eating, what about where we're shopping for our food? This is a big one and I think this will blow your mind. If you don't already think like this, I like to say like a back in the day. That's how I try to live now. Like that's how I've kind of grown up already like I grew vegetables and people think that's harder than it is, but that's definitely a whole nother topic.", " But you don't have to go veggies.", " Think about like what I said before where you go to the communities where the places where you like to eat that serve you well, and if you know me, you know how much I love to shop and cook for food. I share a lot of that on my Instagram and or if you know me in person, you know how much I love cooking like I look for excuses to cook if I'm not already doing it, so", " I love to shop at.", " Farmers markets local food shops just for like basic stuff. I personally do that because when I put myself in that environment I get what I need, it's literally as simple as that and those places that I'm going to have all you need literally, they only stock with a value which is fresh fruit and vegetables pastors meets, you know, like all the nutrient dense foods legumes legumes are I don't think that's how you say it.", " All the stuff that's like honestly all we need back to like the good old days where that's all you had like a caveman diet I'd say and that's what he lived off because I believe that's all we need. Whereas when you put yourself in an environment like will words or coals. Of course, you're going to be sucked into all the distractions like the two dollar tips and like", " all that's on sale because obviously it's all just like marketing to us to our laziness and to how much we love. Well we never really did have to but how much of being convinced to love sales and shit that we just don't need just because it looks good. So like everything even if you do shop there with an untrained eye though.", " It's easy to do that. But keep in mind that all you need is in that veggie area. It's always on like the left or right to bullies you walk in. First of all, does it fruit and veggies because that's most likely what you're going to need to buy and then everything else is that you just luring you into all the shit that you don't need. So that's why it's important to also keep your environment to like the basic places.", " And I love farmers markets because I'm supporting Farmers good people people that are like they're passionate about their work. They're working with the land. They are like God they just amazing like thank God for them because we simply have to create our own culture of going out there supporting them seeing them. They tell you how to cook the food half the time the fruit and veg or whatever it is because their passion and they like to", " to talk to people whereas like that cult that's not really the culture wars and Kohl's and just like I appreciate the culture like that. So that's why I personally do that and I like to experience and see what's out there and I like to have a conversation to so that's why I like I love Byron Bay so much actually because they don't have like the big chains there and they support all of those small companies and", " just just like", " Average people but yeah, I guess like the everyday people that are like trying to make a difference in the world. They don't even have him Bombay like a McDonald's that's how like supportive they are of good fresh food and they their culture is amazing. Like they have their farmers markets once a week, which Melbourne does to the only thing with Melbourne is you do have to travel out at least I'd say 20 minutes from your area.", " Well where I am. Anyway, I'm in the western suburbs. So generally you do have to travel a little bit. But if it's higher priority than that's inconvenience for you, but if you love it, and if you think look how much I can get out of this then of course you're going to go because you know that you're doing good for the environment and you're also looking after yourself because you care to get out there and see what they've got and cook with it and like learn a thing or two.", " But the thing is most people especially in my generation of people they would rather spend 20 minutes to 45 minutes to an hour going out to a club in the city then educating themselves on what they're eating and going out to a farmers market and you know what who cares not everyone has to do that, but for people that do care and are looking to be like", " Do I go and how do I educate myself more and avoid going to Coles and woolies and buying unnecessary shit and just like all those things that I've spoken about then that's where you start.", " Make it a priority be like, you know what I'm getting up on this Saturday. Like why would I sleep in and let's go and see how I can feed myself better and feel better and be more alive because I'm going to go shop for real Whole Foods and or I'm just going to be like, you know what I'm quitting woolies and calls for a week.", " Please have like give yourself a bit of a challenge. Where can I go? Who can I support? What are they got out there and like I'm constantly trying to do that to be like, you know instead of like I go to I go to a bakery that's like five minutes from my house and buy my bread there because they bake it there and there's so kind in there and I would rather that then go to Wally's and spend like $5.00 on a loaf of", " That has no nutrients and that's and I don't even know who's made it as well because I'm like that. I like to like get to the bottom of everything. I want to know what the hell is in everything. I don't wanna spend my money on a random company that does not align with my value. So what do you value? How much do you value your health? It's a very bitter they're very I was going to say but he's so", " so valuable that I can't even talk about it think about it and", " Don't make it too hard. Like if you go out somewhere just starts up a little bit more attention. I'm just start to think about how you feel when you're there or the environment feels like these are all things that you're feeding yourself and it's not just your food to like these are topics. I'm going to speak more about like yourself people places things what you're wearing on my God so many things but till then I hope you've enjoyed today's episode and I look,", " To speaking again. Hopefully you listening to me again. So it's not here. I've recorded this late. So have a good night all day wherever you're at, whatever time and thank you for tuning in and listening to me. And also thank you for listening to the cranky probably volume and voice whatever have it comes out in your ends because it's still a little bit weird for me being my first episode speaking to a phone because I'm usually conversing with people and also,", " So taking breaths in between because it's not it doesn't flowers easier when you're speaking to a phone.
