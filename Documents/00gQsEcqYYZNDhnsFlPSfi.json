I want to support the show. How do I do that?", " I don't want to support patreon and I was like, well first off just listen to the show that's enough.

So let's talk about all of the things that are going on with Nintendo. But first I want to thank Scott Mayhew.", " And for their five star review on Apple podcast, you get everybody who reviews the show over there. You guys are awesome. Thank you so much. Let's let's talk about Cadence of Hyrule Mario is an Italian plumber who under your control enters the Mushroom Kingdom to fight off killer turtles and deadly Ducks until he can Rescue the Princess Toadstool. All right. That was the wrong clip. It should have played Zelda stuff. It's just random. It doesn't matter Cadence of Hyrule. I", " About last time just a little bit. I got through to the first boss and I was able to beat the first boss. They did it on stream over at my twitch stream and it was awesome. It was really really fun. I am now at the second dungeon, so I have been I've continued playing and I've worked my way through and now I found the second dungeon and I am running into a problem. Like I just can't seem to get past it the difficulty of", " Cadence of Hyrule is really really high and it's high enough that I've even considered turning on. I haven't done it yet. But I've considered turning on the mode where it you don't have to do it to the beat of the music everything just kind of moves when you move so you can like move link or Zelda or Cadence and or whatever the the necrodancer 's name is you can move those characters.", " And every time that they move every other monster on the level moves and then you can stop and look and say okay. This guy's got his arm up. So he's going to swing and this guy is about to cast a spell and you know, all of those that like that kind of stuff like you can make all of those decisions and then decide where am I going to move next in move move to that next square and I feel like that kind of takes away a lot of the", " The charm of the game so I don't want to play like that. But right now I am just absolutely slamming my head against a wall trying to figure out what am I doing wrong? Because I can't like I keep missing beats or they'll be too many monsters clustered into an area and so I can't find a way to dance around them so that I can get my attacks off without getting hit myself. I was talking to somebody about this they said bill", " Leave the dungeon and just go look around and try and farm diamonds and farm other stuff go find extra hearts and things like that so that you have more life because that's going to be that's going to help you quite a bit. So I may end up doing that but I I gotta say I love this game but it is it might be beyond my skill level which is too bad. But you know, I finished the first", " And you can do the dungeons in any order. So I finished a dungeon. Maybe I just finished an easier dungeon. And this one seems harder. It's the ice dungeon, by the way, so I'm having a lot of trouble with it, but I'm going to keep plugging away and keep trying and I'm going to resist the urge to turn off the fixed beat mode so that I return on the fixed beat mode so that I don't have to worry about dancing to the beat of the game. I think that that", " That I think that that kind of defeats the purpose of playing this game and if that's what I was going to play then I would just play some other roguelike even though this one has noodles and Oodles of charm. Okay, let's let's let's talk about Super Mario maker to I have to cough real quick. Just a second.", " All right. Sorry about that. So I want to talk about Super Mario maker to that game game is awesome. Yeah, I can't wait until we can play with our friends, but I'm having an absolute blast playing Super Mario maker to now just so everybody knows if you go to run jump stop.com. Mmm as in Mario Maker you can submit your levels that you make to this.", " Spreadsheet which will have a bunch of people's levels on it. I don't know. How many are in there. Now. Let's actually check. Let's go run jump stomp stomp.com. Mmm. Sorry for the typing sounds and what you'll see when you get there. You'll go to my website and it'll you'll scroll down and we'll have a big picture that says Super Mario maker to you click on that and it's going to take you to a Google form where you can submit your information right now. We've", " Five only only five things in there, but that's okay because we're going to get more and you can also shoot I didn't mean to do that. Let me click home. I screwed that up. / mmm. I didn't mean to close it. And then what you can do is if you go to MMM you can bring up the list and it has all of the level IDs listed right there. I will tell you this one the first one level names stuff by Johnny link is", " is really really difficult and you're going to have a hard time finishing that one but it was fun to try Johnny link also said that his next one was going to be easier. So, you know, hopefully more people get in there and post their favorite and it doesn't even have to be one that you made it could be one that you just played and liked and you are sharing it with the community. So like that might be something that I do as well where if I play one on I really like it then I'm going to", " It into the Google form so that people can access these levels and have fun with it because Mario maker to it is just improves upon Mario Maker one in every possible way outside of the fact that there's no amiibo. Like I like the idea that you could put an amiibo in there and it would give you access to play as you know, the Splatoon kids or whatever. I thought that was cool that being taken away I think is", " Kind of lame, but at the end of the day, it really doesn't matter. I've been playing mostly As toad because what you can do is you can go in I think yeah, I think on every type of game you can go in and you can say I want to play as either Mario as Luigi as toad or is Toadette and I've been picking towed his little 8-bit Sprite is hilarious and I like playing as him, but Mario maker to is fantastic. I", " It's so much fun the hundred course chant or the endless course challenge. I think is beyond me. I like I always get like three or four into it and then I just hit a wall and I have this there's a problem with my brain where it's like you can't skip I mean if you skip then you're giving up and I don't like to skip if you didn't know you could just hold down the minus button on the controller for 3 seconds, and it will skip you to the next level I", " Eight skipping. So I end up not doing those endless course challenge where it just keeps giving you random courses, but I've been having a lot of fun just going into the core spot or another core spot the the course selector course world. That's what it's called and scrolling through and looking at one that has had lots of plays that it has lots of hearts on it and selecting it and going through and trying to beat it. I've just been having a blast with it the community", " Is very very good at making Mario levels. They're so much fun. And there's like the one of them that I did and I should probably try and find this and post it to the Run jump stop.com. Mmm, and I'm going to try and do that later on today. I'm pretty busy today though. I'm going to try and do that later, but it had this awesome boss fight where I got to the end and I had to fight Bowser.", " But the only way for me to defeat Bowser I was I was trapped inside a little box. Right and Bowser was off to the to the right and he was breathing fire at me and it just kept shooting mushrooms out to keep me alive. And then I had to do this weird dance with p-switches or I guess not piece which is just switches which kept turning blocks on and off in order to get like turtle shells.", " Has to fall down on Bowser in order to defeat him. It was incredibly clever and it came out of nowhere and I was really surprised when when it happened. I was just like that wasn't a fantastic boss fight and I did that over on my twitch stream and I think I think everybody was pretty impressed with that particular level. So like if there's more like that out there we are in for a real tree now my question is", " Are there levels in Mario Maker? I'm sorry Mario maker to that came from Mario Maker one, and I haven't really thought about it until right now in the middle of telling you about it. I was just curious like I got the game on day one and I loaded it up and there are already like a bunch of levels. So", " I guess I'm wondering how did those all these levels get created so fast and I'm sure there's lots of people who have Mario maker and they you know, they started making levels right away. But do we have some levels from Mario Maker one? And if we do that's really really cool. I also I'm very happy with the filtration system. So you can go through and filter out. You know, I don't want to do these music levels right don't want to do speedrun levels. Although the speedrun levels are have turned out to be my favorite swear.", " you go through and I didn't know this but you can say OK, you'll get 20 seconds to finish this level go and you keep going through and the first one that I did I didn't realize it was a speed run level and I went through and I got right to the end and I wasn't fast enough and I died and I was like, oh my God, I'd had no idea the speedrun levels might be my favorite levels, but you can filter out the stuff that you don't like and just focus drill down on in into the stuff that", " I really do like and I just think that that's fantastic Mario maker to is a treat. It is an absolute treat. I can't wait for us to be able to play together. Once we get that patch, you know, who knows when that's going to happen. Hopefully sooner rather than later. Mr. Tezuka. He has five course creation tips for Super Mario maker to if you want to follow a link in the show notes, you know.", " Some of them are okay, whatever. He's like come up with a title first. It's really not that compelling content. But you know, you know, this is the guy who he's been making Mario levels for a very very long time. So the five course creation tips from mr. Tezuka as over on Nintendo's YouTube channel, and if you just go to run jump Stomp.com and this is episode 359 you will see a link in the show notes for that.

Even then he said Nintendo switch logo has been changed on this. So it looks like we're there. You know how it's got like the black Joy icon in the white Joy icon and then they have the opposite colors in the and the switch logo. They've replaced the joy cons the like the thumbsticks the circles that are usually there with little Cog Wheels.

And I you know, if it's you I hope that you message me and let me know that you won because that thing is just so cool. And honestly, if you haven't played any of the steam World Games you're missing out on a some fantastic games and they're from all different genres. So", " for instance, if you're looking for a game that is a tactical game turn-based tactical then you want to check out steamworld Heist. It's basically like XCOM or Mario plus Rabbids, but in the steam World Universe where you are like these robots who are on a spaceship and you're going from place to place and fighting against like space pirates and stuff like that. It's really awesome. If a metroidvania game is more your jam then check out steamworld dig in.", " Steamworld dig to those games are ridiculously good especially steamworld dig to it's one of my favorite metroidvania has of all times. So definitely check that out. And then if you're looking for an old-school jrpg where they kind of Base the combat on having cards in your hand, you're like, okay. Well, I've got these cards. I'm going to use this card and it uses up my Mana then steamrolled Quest is going to be something that you're going to want to check out and if", " If any of those games sound cool just go to my YouTube channel youtube.com slash run jump stop and I bet you if you type in Steam world.

I hope I win but I doubt I will but anyway, let's talk about something else that I'm never ever going to win. And that's Tetris 99 the highest place that I've ever gotten on Tetris 99 is second place and I was very happy to get there but they keep having these Tetris", " 99 online competitions, which I think are very cool. The last one gave you the ability to unlock like a Game Boy style theme for Tetris 99 and all you really had to do is at worst play a play like 50 games.", " Nobody's going to have to play 50 games in order to unlock that or nobody had to that would mean that you had to come in last place every single time.", " What was it? Oh, yeah. Yeah. So the higher you place the more points you get and then though you once you earn a hundred points, you unlock the whatever it is in the case of last time. It was a my God. My brain stopped working. It was a theme for for it via Game Boy this time. It is a instead of a Gameboy theme. It looks like it is a Tetris or I'm sorry, not a Tetris theme.", " Splatoon theme. So this is coming to us from a tweet from nin switch news, which was actually talking about something from Nintendo everything but I followed it to the original source. And this is a Nintendo's Japanese website and I'm scrolling scrolling scrolling and here it is right here. So this is the fifth Tetris Maximus cup. It's called the splits.", " Tune collaboration festival and it says Nintendo switch on in this is automatically translated. So it's going to be really broken English and stuff.

This is auto translated. So it's really hard to get.", " You're saying but the I already kind of covered the gist of it if you like Tetris 99 if you're a fan of Splatoon, and if you want to try and earn that then you're going to want to do that and it happens on July 12 starting at 4 p.m. I'm not sure if that's it's probably Japan time and it goes until July 16th when looks like 350.", " Nine PM. Also Japan time. Now are we going to be able to do this in the states or in Europe or in in the other areas? I don't know because I don't I haven't seen anything about this from Nintendo Europe. I haven't seen anything about this from Nintendo America. However in the past from with Tetris 99, they've kind of duplicated their efforts they call them different things, but they duplicate their efforts and", " Same all over the place. So I fully expect that. We will see something from Nintendo of America about this. However, it's free to make a Japanese Nintendo switch account. So all you had all you would have to do is log in with a Japanese account and then you could probably play this part and it's not like you have to be able to read anything when you're playing Tetris and my guess is you would probably be able to unlock this. Anyway, I'm definitely going to try because I love touch.", " There's 99. It's a fun game and you really don't have to play that many games in order to get those 100 points that they're talking about. Okay, Dragon Quest Builders to it has a demo out last time. I just mentioned that the demo was out and now I have played the demo. I did not play the entire demo. I played up to the point where you can save and you know, there's a lot of people who are confused about this.", " I wanted to address it and I think I could be wrong about this. But I think that they there's a good reason why you can't save Beyond a certain point. I think the game is generated procedurally so that when I'm playing and when you're playing we will have a different experience like the you all have all the same stuff but it would be in different places. At least that's what it seemed like from what I read when I was playing the demo because", " Cuz you start out you're on a boat with a bunch of monsters and the monsters are like, hey, dummy, go do all these things and it's basically teaching you how to play the game, which is great because I didn't play the first one and it's really cool. The thing that one thing that surprised me is you can go into first person mode and play in first person mode, which I thought that I would really like because I played a lot of Minecraft, but I actually prefer to play this in third person mode. It's much better the cameras up higher you can see more of the world and you", " Turn around faster as well. Because if you're playing in first person mode and you want to turn around like the character has to go to to to to to and turn all the way around. Whereas if you're playing a third person mode and you just point your stick the other direction your character just spins around instantaneously, but you will break stuff down you'll build things in a little crafting table like Minecraft you place blocks. It's basically Minecraft in a dragon.", " The universe and its really fun the the the quests and the text dialog is all super cornball, but it's also really charming and I liked it. So I had a lot of fun with Dragon Quest Builders to I'm not going to get it right away because I've just got too much to play but it's definitely something that I'm going to be watching to come out on a like on sale or something. Let's let's", " Going to skip this story about Layton and just let you know that the that there's a latent game called catch real the millionaire conspiracy deluxe edition coming to switch on August 11th.
